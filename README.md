Remember that mob from Minecraft that upon creation was uncontrollable and went out destroying the world?
My wither can go into the digital world - the internet - and collect information associated to the topic you wish.
It doesn't destroy anything, so the internet is safe, folks, don't worry.

#### General Idea
---
Now, I realized that more control over wither may actually be more beneficial to you so you can control which sources collected will be processed.
Additionally, you can provide your own sources to process such as pdfs, urls or just plainly copied content.

For now there are two ways of processing possible (more are being developed):
1. Summary generation (pdf only, for now)
- page summaries -> chapter summaries -> book summary
2. Q&A Extraction (url only, for now)
- type the topic you're interested in and wait a few seconds
- choose the sources to process, you will see the titles and sources - so you can check them out before deciding
- let the processing begin, this will take a while as the algorithm is rather thorough (meaning, llm improves the answers of other llm)
- you can query your database with instantaneous results

How is it better than typical browser search results or llm response?
- thanks to vector search, you are returned with questions most similar to yours, so this allows for answers from different viewpoints, different explanations of the same thing, reassurance of validity
- you have sources! You can check out more of the stuff that piques your interest

#### Side Note
Initially I wanted to make this project solely for me, and thus no tutorial for installation was made, as I am still working on the project in general. It will be made in the future though, don't worry.
