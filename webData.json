We were putting together training packages for new recruits and one piece of advice that was given during sales was: Always sell with three things. Three benefits, three features, three possibilities. Two is insufficient for a product to look as if it is worth investment; it falls short. Four, and you’re trying too hard- it appeared as though your product falls short, but this time, you’re overcompensating as a result. This is essentially why ‘rule of three’ is the all time favourite for every persuasive writing scheme passed through secondary schools, and the one that students remember (along with hyper-bowl. Every time). But why is it that three is the magic number? There’s a few areas at play here: the role of memory, how we impart the three things, the purpose of what we are using the rule of three for, and for the purposes of revision, how to apply it effectively. Your short term memory- the one we often refer to as the memory that helps us to remember what we ate for lunch yesterday- isn’t actually the first memory in use. Well, it is, but we often talk about it in the wrong way. Working memory is the memory store that takes in information as we are given it, where it is held for 15-30 seconds before we either do something with it, or it’s lost. Of this working memory, Baddesley’s model states that this segment of working memory stores in three different ways; phonological loop, episodic buffer and dual coding mean machine, the visuospatial sketchpad. The episodic buffer wasn’t added to this model until a later point, but the two original storage areas in working memory explain why we struggle to listen to two people giving information (noise levels allowing), or read and speak at the same time. This is why ‘reading along,’ or exploring vocabulary in context is so challenging and counter productive ( see David Didau’s post here for further exploration on reading aloud and memory.) As I understand it, this 30 second (approximation) window then allows us to make the choice to lose the information forever, repeat the act of gaining the information so that it becomes memorable through finding a connection with our long term memory or find some way of transferring into our long term memory, by making it memorable in some way, or the act of repeating until it forms meaning by way of a recognised structure. Your working memory will also only hold a limited amount of information before being forced to put it elsewhere- process it as something worth hanging on to, or discard it and if you do feel it was important, you must regain the information and start again. Retaking a date of birth, or respelling an unknown word. I wanted to work out why three things were important; students’ ears perk up when I say I have ‘three top tips’ for them. Like one wasn’t enough. But is it simply that the fact that there are three of them actually make it more of a certainty that the information will get through to the long term memory Hall of Fame? Or, is it because three is a number that our working memory is used to working with? That my top tips may not make it to the forever bank, but there is comfort that there are three facts that could possibly float about somewhere, for use at a later point? I’m not in a position to confirm, but I know that three brings me comfort as a teacher, and helps me to focus in the midst of exam season, when there is a danger to overload students and repeat everything you ever taught (Chris Curtis wrote a great piece about being a rudder here). Three things keeps me succinct, at a point where students are looking for the silver bullet. Some of my three things for revision: Magic three for anthology Retrieval Practice; three things about context, three things about language, three things about the structure. If students are struggling to explore structure (which is what happens), I advise to speculate on the title choice, the relationship between the first and final line, and the arrangement of the poem, of it reflects the poem in some way. ‘It flows’ is strictly off the table. I tend to find that once they have the most vivid aspects of the poem to hand, the rest comes back to them. Physically, emotionally, psychologically; more about this in my post here. Magic three for academic writing; never I, write at a distance, tiptoe in. To drive critical voice, we remove ourselves from the response (this is particularly valuable for evaluation questions where students are just dying to state,’ I agree’ because after all, that’s what we do when someone asks to what extent we agree with something. To write at a distance, we ensure that we haven’t jumped into the text, Dick Van Dyke style, and are referring to characters like they are real people. Sheila Birling is NOT open minded, because we don’t know her mind, because she doesn’t exist. Priestley depicts Sheila as someone who has a moral compass, because he wants to present a liberally minded role model with changed option to young people, but particularly young women. Tiptoe in: tentative language. Possibly, could be, perhaps. Don’t commit. You’re an academic, not a mind reader. A 3A thesis; for literature, students remember three sophisticated adjectives to describe characters. Becky Wood put some fantastic vocabulary lists together for Romeo And Juliet that my students loved, and thanks to Natalie for her amazing A Christmas Carol list. Students then choose three words to explore the character, the final one being a trait that the character doesn’t possess until a change or development in the plot prompts them to do so. These three words then act as a starting point, but also form a loose plan for character questions for responses. For example, ‘It could be argued that Dickens depicts Scrooge cruel, usurious and vulnerable (don’t forget your academic magic 3 here, kids).’ The inclusion of vulnerability allows us to explore how the ghosts present the opportunity for Scrooge to experience vulnerability, so that he can then develop feelings of empathy. I’ve included four examples, just to test your working memory. You’re welcome.

A lot of stress, however, can create more of an obstacle than a benefit. This is true when it comes to many things, including health-promoting behaviors, relationships, and even our memory. Stress can inhibit the way we form and retrieve memories, ultimately affecting how our memory works. Learn what studies show about the relationship between stress and memory, as well as how to reverse memory loss from stress. How Stress Affects Memory Research has found that stress affects our memory in many ways, each of which has different impacts. Stress and Memory Formation Stress can affect how memories are formed. When stressed, people have a more difficult time creating short-term memories and turning those short-term memories into long-term memories. This means that it is more difficult to learn when stressed. Memories can also change after they are formed. Every time we retrieve a memory, we color it with our present experience of it—like when we take something off a shelf and then put it back, leaving another set of fingerprints from having handled it again. Stress and Memory Type Stress can affect the type of memories we form as well. If we are stressed during an event, we may have more difficulty accurately remembering the details of the event later. The stress colors our perception as well as our ability to recall what we perceived. This is part of why eyewitness testimony is so unreliable. People can't be absolutely sure that they remember what they saw correctly. Research shows that if people are questioned and given misleading information about something they experienced, that information will influence their memory and what they thought they experienced. This new, yet faulty information is then easier to recall because it is more recent than the event itself. This is why false memories can be created with well-intentioned lines of questioning. Additional Impacts A meta-analysis was conducted on 113 stress studies, meaning that researchers examined these independent studies to determine their major findings. What do these studies show about the relationship between stress and money? Timing of the stressor matters. One of the most interesting findings was that stress could impede the formation of memories if it occurred prior to or during encoding, the time during which the memory is formed. But post-encoding stress actually improved memory formation and retrieval, meaning stress that occurred after the memory was formed actually led to better memory-making. Cortisol increases don't affect memory. Stress increases cortisol, but studies found no correlation between cortisol amounts and the effects of stress on memory. This means that if you create more cortisol during your stress response, this won't necessarily mean that your memory will be more impaired than someone less hormonally-responsive. Interestingly, women who were on oral contraceptives experienced less of a negative effect. Stress-related exhaustion has negative impacts. Stress can also lead to exhaustion, and this can lead to cognitive impairment that includes issues with attention and working memory. Unfortunately, memory impairment can still be detected three years later, even after the exhaustion has been addressed. This underscores the importance of managing stress before it gets to this point. Improve Your Memory Under Stress There are several things you can do to improve your memory when stressed. Fortunately, these techniques also help manage stress. One of the most important is to practice personal self-care: get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, and manage stress. Poor sleep, high stress, and other physical problems can affect memory as well as contribute to the stress that impedes memory formation and retrieval. Other important strategies work as well. Here are some research-backed strategies to try: Train yourself in breathing exercises and other relaxation techniques. One study of police cadets found that psychological performance training improved the recall of cadets who experienced stress. Techniques used included breathing exercises, mental imagery, and attentional focus. When stressed, try these techniques to improve recall. Get moving. A study examining the effects of aerobic exercise on people with memory impairment found that a 12-week workout program indeed improved their memory. The subjects were experiencing mild cognitive impairment from stress-related exhaustion, so these results are especially relevant for those who are stressed. Practice mindfulness. Researchers have also found that practicing mindfulness can help with memory not only by minimizing stress but also by enabling better quality sleep. One study found that practicing mindfulness resulted in less stress as well as fewer memory issues and sleep problems. Additionally, since mindfulness is based around being more aware and present, you may be better able to pay attention to and remember details you might not have otherwise. Summary Stress impacts so much of our lives, and although we can't always eliminate that stress entirely, we can learn to manage it in a way that will help support self-improvement in many areas of our lives, including improved memory. 9 Sources Verywell Mind uses only high-quality sources, including peer-reviewed studies, to support the facts within our articles.

Disney/Pixar Email X (Twitter) Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Disney/Pixar’s newest film, Inside Out, tells the story of 11-year-old Riley and her difficulty dealing with a family move to San Francisco. The film is getting a lot of attention for its depiction of emotion and memory. The filmmakers consulted with neuroscientists and psychologists to help make sure they got the science right. As a cognitive psychologist who studies memory, I was excited to see how the film showed the relationship between memory and emotion. The action primarily takes place within Riley’s mind, with anthropomorphic emotions – Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust – as the main characters. Riley’s mind is shown to be vast, comprising many individual units (Imagination Land and Abstract Thought, for instance). The central location of the story is Headquarters, which corresponds to the current contents of Riley’s consciousness – what she is perceiving from the world around her and what the emotions and other “mind workers” choose to show her in the form of memories or ideas. In some respects, the movie captures the science behind memory and emotion really well, such as how remembering past events can regulate emotion. Memories allow us to mentally time travel and to relive the past in the present. The character of Joy frequently recalls past memories of pleasant events in order to make Riley happy in the moment. One recurring plot point is how memories can be changed when they are remembered. In the movie, memories are shown as translucent globes encapsulating events. Each globe takes on a different hue depending on the primary emotion of the event. A golden-hued joyful memory starts to turn blue when held by Sadness, showing the transformation of a previously happy memory to one that becomes bittersweet with the acknowledgment of loss. It’s well-established that the emotional character of events is sometimes altered as we recall them. Although certainly some events become more negative over time (which is depicted in the film), more often memories become more positive in retrospect. This positivity bias in remembering the past has been called the Pollyanna Principle, and it is a normal, healthy aspect of remembering. The relationship between sleep and memory is also portrayed well. Sleep is presented as a time for moving the day’s memories into long-term storage. We know that sleep is an active part of the consolidation process which makes memories of all types more durable. And, dreams are shown to comprise components of the days’ events, only distorted and with the addition of fantastical and absurd elements. This seems to reflect how our minds consolidate memories and make sense of what we learn. Inside Out does well when it comes to the interplay of memory and emotion, but the memory basics are a bit misleading. When we remember something, we put the pieces back together. Puzzle via www.shutterstock.com. We reconstruct memories when we retrieve them The film shows memories as stable and complete representations of actual events – something we know is not the case. The events of Riley’s day are automatically “encoded” into a single globe. Each memory globe is “stored” somewhere on a shelf in a vast long-term storage library. Memories are “retrieved” and sent intact and exact, back to Headquarters and, therefore, to consciousness. That might be a handy visual metaphor for memory, but it’s not actually how memory works. We do encode events from our daily life without a deliberate intention to learn or remember them. For instance, you remember what you had for breakfast today even though you did not have to try to remember that information. But, our brain doesn’t store each memory as an individual whole unit. Instead scholars believe that the components of events are processed by individual neural modules. Our brain has separate systems for basic cognitive functions: vision, hearing, language, emotion and so on. Visual components are processed by the visual system, auditory components by the auditory system, emotional components by the limbic system. Memories are stored in bits and pieces all over your brain. There is no globe sitting on a shelf that can be retrieved and used to reproduce the event exactly as it happened. When we retrieve a memory, we reconstruct it from those component pieces. We use the same neural systems that encoded the components to see the event in our mind’s eye, hear it in our mind’s ear and re-experience the emotions associated with the event. That reconstructive process is influenced by what we know about the world around us, our current thoughts and beliefs, and our ongoing goals. So our memories can change over time, just as we do through the years. In fact, each time we remember an event, we are simultaneously re-encoding that event, making it less likely to be forgotten. The brain doesn’t discard old memories Forgetting is another area where the movie represents a common but unsupported theory. The memory globes are shown as becoming less colorful and more dim as they grow older and are not retrieved. They eventually turn dark and gray and are sent to the “memory dump” where they turn to dust and disappear forever. This corresponds to a decay theory of forgetting, which suggests that time leads to permanent loss of information. But psychologists tend to think of forgetting more as a temporary lapse in memory. There is much research to show that although some information cannot be recalled at will, there is still evidence of prior learning. The information may come to mind with the right reminder, or it may be more quickly recognized, or it may take less time to re-learn that information. Full-fledged memories may fade, but they leave some trace behind. We don’t store memories likes books on shelves. Books via www.shutterstock.com. Memories connect to one another In the film, memories are stored on shelves, each in a single space like books in a library. This doesn’t capture how interconnected our memories are. Memories are stored in component parts. Each individual memory shares features with many other memories – such as the processing components that encode each element, the content details like who was there, where the event took place, or when the event occurred, and the abstract themes like spiritual experiences, romantic moments, or professional accomplishments. The movie tries to capture our ability to identify overarching themes and causal chains among our memories by showing how “core memories” fuel aspects of Riley’s personality, but this serves to emphasize individual memories rather than constellations of interrelated memories. Although we may have specific self-defining memories, these are typically quintessential examples of larger patterns in our lives. Our memory is less like the public library with many books on the shelves and more like Wikipedia with its many linked pages of information. Overall, the movie does a great job of showing the complexity of the human mind. Even if not all of the details are completely accurate, the metaphors are grounded in a real understanding of psychological science. Yes, it perpetuates some myths about memory, but to be fair, the focus is on feelings, and it conveys the relationship between memory and emotion well. Plus, it’s a fun adventure story with a terrific message that is well worth watching.

Because it makes up the very framework through which we make sense of and take action within the present, its importance goes without saying. But how exactly does it work? And how can teachers apply a better understanding of its inner workings to their own teaching? In light of current research in cognitive science, the very, very short answer to these questions is that memory operates according to a \"dual-process,\" where more unconscious, more routine thought processes (known as \"System 1\") interact with more conscious, more problem-based thought processes (known as \"System 2\"). At each of these two levels, in turn, there are the processes through which we \"get information in\" (encoding), how we hold on to it (storage), and and how we \"get it back out\" (retrieval or recall). With a basic understanding of how these elements of memory work together, teachers can maximize student learning by knowing how much new information to introduce, when to introduce it, and how to sequence assignments that will both reinforce the retention of facts (System 1) and build toward critical, creative thinking (System 2). Dual-Process Theory Think back to a time when you learned a new skill, such as driving a car, riding a bicycle, or reading. When you first learned this skill, performing it was an active process in which you analyzed and were acutely aware of every movement you made. Part of this analytical process also meant that you thought carefully about why you were doing what you were doing, to understand how these individual steps fit together as a comprehensive whole. However, as your ability improved, performing the skill stopped being a cognitively-demanding process, instead becoming more intuitive. As you continue to master the skill, you can perform other, at times more intellectually-demanding, tasks simultaneously. Due to your knowledge of this skill or process being unconscious, you could, for example, solve an unrelated complex problem or make an analytical decision while completing it. In its simplest form, the scenario above is an example of what psychologists call dual-process theory. The term “dual-process” refers to the idea that some behaviors and cognitive processes (such as decision-making) are the products of two distinct cognitive processes, often called System 1 and System 2 (Kaufmann, 2011:443-445). While System 1 is characterized by automatic, unconscious thought, System 2 is characterized by effortful, analytical, intentional thought (Osman, 2004:989). Figure 1: A summary of System 1 and System 2. (Source: Upfront Analytics, 2015) Dual-Process Theories and Learning How do System 1 and System 2 thinking relate to teaching and learning? In an educational context, System 1 is associated with memorization and recall of information, while System 2 describes more analytical or critical thinking. Memory and recall, as a part of System 1 cognition, are focused on in the rest of these notes. As mentioned above, System 1 is characterized by its fast, unconscious recall of previously-memorized information. Classroom activities that would draw heavily on System 1 include memorized multiplication tables, as well as multiple-choice exam questions that only need exact regurgitation from a source such as a textbook. These kinds of tasks do not require students to actively analyze what is being asked of them beyond reiterating memorized material. System 2 thinking becomes necessary when students are presented with activities and assignments that require them to provide a novel solution to a problem, engage in critical thinking, or apply a concept outside of the domain in which it was originally presented. It may be tempting to think of learning beyond the primary school level as being all about System 2, all the time. However, it’s important to keep in mind that successful System 2 thinking depends on a lot of System 1 thinking to operate. In other words, critical thinking requires a lot of memorized knowledge and intuitive, automatic judgments to be performed quickly and accurately. How does Memory Work? In its simplest form, memory refers to the continued process of information retention over time. It is an integral part of human cognition, since it allows individuals to recall and draw upon past events to frame their understanding of and behavior within the present. Memory also gives individuals a framework through which to make sense of the present and future. As such, memory plays a crucial role in teaching and learning. There are three main processes that characterize how memory works. These processes are encoding, storage, and retrieval (or recall). Encoding. Encoding refers to the process through which information is learned. That is, how information is taken in, understood, and altered to better support storage (which you will look at in Section 3.1.2). Information is usually encoded through one (or more) of four methods: (1) Visual encoding (how something looks); (2) acoustic encoding (how something sounds); (3) semantic encoding (what something means); and (4) tactile encoding (how something feels). While information typically enters the memory system through one of these modes, the form in which this information is stored may differ from its original, encoded form (Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel, 2014). Storage. Storage refers to how, where, how much, and how long encoded information is retained within the memory system. The modal model of memory (storage) highlights the existence of two types of memory: short-term and long-term memory. Encoded information is first stored in short-term memory and then, if need be, is stored in long-term memory (Roediger & McDermott, 1995). Atkinson and Shiffrin argue that information that is encoded acoustically is primarily stored in short-term memory (STM), and it is only kept there through constant repetition (rehearsal). Time and inattention may cause information stored in STM to be forgotten. This is because short-term memory only lasts between 15 and 30 seconds. Additionally, STM only stores between five and nine items of information, with seven items being the average number. In this context, the term “items” refers to any piece of information. Long-term memory, however, has immense storage capacity, and information stored within LTM can be stored there indefinitely. Information that is encoded semantically is primarily stored in LTM; however, LTM also stores visually- and acoustically-encoded information. Once information is stored within LTM or STM, individuals need to recall or retrieve it to make use of said information (Roediger & McDermott, 1995). It is this retrieval process that often determines how well students perform on assignments designed to test recall. Figure 2: The differences between STM and LTM. (Adapted from: Roediger & McDermott, 1995) Retrieval. As indicated above, retrieval is the process through which individuals access stored information. Due to their differences, information stored in STM and LTM are retrieved differently. While STM is retrieved in the order in which it is stored (for example, a sequential list of numbers), LTM is retrieved through association (for example, remembering where you parked your car by returning to the entrance through which you accessed a shopping mall) (Roediger & McDermott, 1995). Improving Recall Retrieval is subject to error, because it can reflect a reconstruction of memory. This reconstruction becomes necessary when stored information is lost over time due to decayed retention. In 1885, Hermann Ebbinghaus conducted an experiment in which he tested how well individuals remembered a list of nonsense syllables over increasingly longer periods of time. Using the results of his experiment, he created what is now known as the “Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve” (Schaefer, 2015). Figure 3: The Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve. (Source: Schaefer, 2015) Through his research, Ebbinghaus concluded that the rate at which your memory (of recently learned information) decays depends both on the time that has elapsed following your learning experience as well as how strong your memory is. Some degree of memory decay is inevitable, so, as an educator, how do you reduce the scope of this memory loss? The following sections answer this question by looking at how to improve recall within a learning environment, through various teaching and learning techniques. As a teacher, it is important to be aware of techniques that you can use to promote better retention and recall among your students. Three such techniques are the testing effect, spacing, and interleaving. The testing effect. In most traditional educational settings, tests are normally considered to be a method of periodic but infrequent assessment that can help a teacher understand how well their students have learned the material at hand. However, modern research in psychology suggests that frequent, small tests are also one of the best ways to learn in the first place. The testing effect refers to the process of actively and frequently testing memory retention when learning new information. By encouraging students to regularly recall information they have recently learned, you are helping them to retain that information in long-term memory, which they can draw upon at a later stage of the learning experience (Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel, 2014). As secondary benefits, frequent testing allows both the teacher and the student to keep track of what a student has learned about a topic, and what they need to revise for retention purposes. Frequent testing can occur at any point in the learning process. For example, at the end of a lecture or seminar, you could give your students a brief, low-stakes quiz or free-response question asking them to remember what they learned that day, or the day before. This kind of quiz will not just tell you what your students are retaining, but will help them remember more than they would have otherwise. Spacing. According to the spacing effect, when a student repeatedly learns and recalls information over a prolonged time span, they are more likely to retain that information. This is compared to learning (and attempting to retain) information in a short time span (for example, studying the day before an exam). As a teacher, you can foster this approach to studying in your students by structuring your learning experiences in the same way. For example, instead of introducing a new topic and its related concepts to students in one go, you can cover the topic in segments over multiple lessons (Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel, 2014). Interleaving. The interleaving technique is another teaching and learning approach that was introduced as an alternative to a technique known as “blocking”. Blocking refers to when a student practices one skill or one topic at a time. Interleaving, on the other hand, is when students practice multiple related skills in the same session. This technique has proven to be more successful than the traditional blocking technique in various fields (Brown, Roediger, & McDaniel, 2014). As useful as it is to know which techniques you can use, as a teacher, to improve student recall of information, it is also crucial for students to be aware of techniques they can use to improve their own recall. This section looks at four of these techniques: state-dependent memory, schemas, chunking, and deliberate practice. State-dependent memory. State-dependent memory refers to the idea that being in the same state in which you first learned information enables you to better remember said information. In this instance, “state” refers to an individual’s surroundings, as well as their me","question":null,"answer":null},{"id":null,"source":"https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/how-memory-works","content":"ntal and physical state at the time of learning (Weissenborn & Duka, 2000). Schemas. Schemas refer to the mental frameworks an individual creates to help them understand and organize new information. Schemas act as a cognitive “shortcut” in that they allow individuals to interpret new information quicker than when not using schemas. However, schemas may also prevent individuals from learning pertinent information that falls outside the scope of the schema that has been created. It is because of this that students should be encouraged to alter or reanalyze their schemas, when necessary, when they learn important information that may not confirm or align with their existing beliefs and conceptions of a topic. Chunking. Chunking is the process of grouping pieces of information together to better facilitate retention. Instead of recalling each piece individually, individuals recall the entire group, and then can retrieve each item from that group more easily (Gobet et al., 2001). Deliberate practice. The final technique that students can use to improve recall is deliberate practice. Simply put, deliberate practice refers to the act of deliberately and actively practicing a skill with the intention of improving understanding of and performance in said skill. By encouraging students to practice a skill continually and deliberately (for example, writing a well-structured essay), you will ensure better retention of that skill (Brown et al., 2014).

Explore resources About us Partner with us Donate What is working memory? By Peg Rosen Expert reviewed by Nelson Dorta, PhD Español At a glance Working memory is like a temporary sticky note in the brain. It’s a skill that lets us work with information without losing track of what we’re doing. Kids and adults who learn and think differently often struggle with working memory. Working memory is one of the brain’s executive functions. It’s a skill that allows us to work with information without losing track of what we’re doing. Think of working memory as a temporary sticky note in the brain. It holds new information in place so the brain can work with it briefly and connect it with other information. For example, in math class, working memory lets kids “see” in their head the numbers the teacher is saying. They might not remember any of these numbers by the next class or even 10 minutes later. But that’s OK. Working memory has done its short-term job by helping them tackle the task at hand. Working memory isn’t just for short-term use. It also helps the brain organize new information for long-term storage. When people have trouble with working memory, the brain may store information in a jumbled way. Or it may not store it for the long term at all. Sometimes, what may look like trouble with working memory is actually an attention issue: The information was never put into the brain’s storage system in the first place. Learn more about the differences between attention and working memory. Dive deeper Examples of trouble with working memory Here are examples of what it looks like when people struggle with working memory. Doing mental math. The teacher asks kids to add 21 and 13 in their heads, and then subtract 6 from the sum. Kids might remember the numbers the teacher said to add: 21 and 13. But they might not recall what they’re supposed to do with them. Or they might not hold on to the sum (34) so they can subtract 6 from it. Following practical instructions. When people are told a set of instructions, like driving directions, they may not remember all of the steps. Or they might not remember the correct order. Using information later. Some people may find that the information they have remembered doesn’t make much sense. Because of working memory problems, the brain didn’t package it properly in the first place. People who learn and think differently often have trouble with working memory. This is especially true of kids and adults with ADHD. That’s because ADHD is linked to trouble with executive function skills, like working memory. Learn more about executive function. See a list of ADHD signs at different ages. How educators can help When kids struggle with working memory, educators can teach strategies to help them work around the problem. Strategy instruction is a teaching practice that shows kids how to learn the content or skills they need to acquire. Kids learn strategies like note-taking to help them process, remember, and express the information they learn. Or they might learn how to break down tasks into a manageable number of steps. Learn more about strategy instruction. Next steps for families If you think your child has trouble with working memory, it’s important to find out if that’s really the case. An evaluation can show where kids are struggling, and where they have strengths. There are also simple things you can do at home to help kids improve working memory.

I don't know if it's working yet, so I'd like to learn a little more about how the machine works so I can figure out what's going on - If I understand correctly, the Micro Complex module moves the OS to memory location 0F000H. But I can't find out which memory location the OS is normally in. How can I know if the normal mode or the new memory location mode is activated? - The module has a switch, which apparently allows you to switch from one rom to another, and/or from one memory address (original or moved) to another. If I understand correctly, there are two copies of the same OS in each EPROM by default, and all you do is change the memory address with the switch. Is this correct? - Apparently, there's also a Microcomplex floppy control in the machine, and a ram card. So I think it's been modified to run software from the floppy. Unfortunately, there's no floppy drive. I was thinking of loading software via the cassette adapter at first, but I read that the Micro complexe personality module no longer had the commands for the cassette. This leaves the option of loading software via the serial port from a computer, but my question is: with the changes made to the memory addresses and this Micro complex module, is this still possible? Thanks for your help.

G guibrush Member Joined May 3, 2023 Messages 40 Aug 3, 2023 #6 I received my SOL-20 yesterday. It is indeed equipped with a Micro-Complex personnality card. There's also an expansion card attached directly to the motherboard, the Micro Complex Dual 80/64 card, which apparently allows 80-column video mode and continuous use of the 64k ram. There's also a 64k Expandoram RAM card and a Micro Complex Phase Lock II floppy controller card (apparently, the previous owner was a Micro Complex fan). The machine works! I have a prompt in both personality module modes (basic video and 80-column mode). The keyboard doesn't work (normal, because of the foam pads), nor does the ON/OFF button or the fan. I ordered a SUN Type 4 keyboard to take its pads. So I'm pretty lucky with this machine - I didn't expect so much! Now all I have to do, once the keyboard is fixed, is try to run software on it, and possibly use a floppy drive. Questions : - Do you know if there's an S-100 card with an SD or CF card that would allow me to run software on the SOL-20? - Floppy disk drives are apparently hard sectored. Has anyone ever successfully used a Gotek on a Sol-20?

I use the Northstar Double density controller card. No support software is required it is all in the ROM's on the card, just type EX E800 and you can run the drives. With a CP/M 2.2 disk in the drives, all works fine. I put two drive units into an enclosure with Mike's VSG, here is the article describing it. https://www.worldphaco.com/uploads/EXTERNAL_DUAL_5.pdf Once I got that running I was able to also use the assembler and make some fun programs, like Steve, my \"Walking Man\" I got the idea when I saw one on a display at a pedestrian crossing: One thing about the SOL, it is super easy to get programs in and out of it, on its serial port, especially .ENT files. It is fun watching the files transfer like some ghost is high speed typing the bytes. G guibrush Member Joined May 3, 2023 Messages 40 Aug 4, 2023 #8 Hi thanks for the tip! Yes, I’m planning to feed softwares in .ENT format via the serial port, I already borrowed some on the web. That’s a good hint! I just have to repair the keyboard first to be able to type the commands. About the floppy: this looks doable. Your mod is awesome! I have the VSG hard sector simulator, this is a good idea. I’m using it now in another computer ( a Swiss Smaky 6) But I can borrow it. Can you tell me what kind of floppy drive will work on the SOL? I see different format when I‘m browsing .Img files on the web, and I don’t know which one is the good one. It is possible to create the floppy via the SOL and the serial port? If not, is there a possibility to create them with another methode? Many thanks for your help?

On the keyboard, I made a tester for it and wrote an article with a lot of detail on how the interesting keyboard works: https://www.worldphaco.com/uploads/HARDWARE_DIAGNOSTIC_TOOL_FOR_THE_SOL.pdf H Hugo Holden Veteran Member Joined Dec 23, 2015 Messages 5,105 Location Australia Aug 4, 2023 #10 Also, if you decide to get interested in the SOL's Tape interface, it is a very clever and interesting system, here is an article I wrote on it: https://www.worldphaco.com/uploads/The_SOL-20_tape.pdf I think the SOL-20 is the most interesting S-100 computer of all, because of all of its unique features, its top keyboard and tape interface and the SOLOS monitor that make is quite unique and user friendly system. H Hugo Holden Veteran Member Joined Dec 23, 2015 Messages 5,105 Location Australia Aug 5, 2023 #11 PS: as you can see from the article, I used YD-580 disk drives, the reason was they were new old stock and setting the system up, for the first time, I wanted to remove variables like faulty used drives. I bought a few of these drives on ebay and made duplicate units and two controller cards for comparison purposes. Once a setup is working, if it fails, its generally easy to find out why, where the fault is, controller card, drive etc, if the system never worked in the first place there could be multiple problems in different places at once. Having said that out of the unused drive units I bought one had a faulty IC in it from new with a really oddball fault, it worked on its own but inhibited any other drive it was paired with. I found out later that the chip sets in these particular YD drives won't let them play a hard sector disk. G guibrush Member Joined May 3, 2023 Messages 40 Aug 5, 2023 #12 thank you very much for all this information. Your article on the floppy is very well done and gives me the mechanical information to try to do the same thing. Thanks a lot for the floppy drive model Could you tell me the format/capacity of the floppies you're using on it, so I know which images are the right ones, or possibly point me to the right image files online? I have a friend who can write me soft sectored diskettes, but I'll need to know what the right disk images are. Your article on the keyboard is very interesting too, it explains why the pads I bought from an Italian seller only work partially in the SOL-20 keyboard (in fact, some pads work on the same track, others don't, which shows that they're on the edge). These are the ones: https://www.ebay.com/itm/275298265301 I found another source of pads 105 \"Foam and Foil\" Capacitive Pads for KeyTronic & BTC Keyboard Repair - TexElec This set of 105 count foam capacitive pads for repairing vintage KeyTronic and BTC keyboards with deteriorating foam pads. These are homemade in house and the 105 should cover what you need with a few extras for your convenience. These will work on keyboards for many different kinds of vintage... texelec.com they claim that the latest version of their pads work well on the SOL-20 keyboard, I'll give it a try. Regarding your article on the cassette interface, it's also very interesting. My main problem is that, as I have the Micro Complex personnality module, the cassette routines are no longer there, so I can't use the cassette interface. H Hugo Holden Veteran Member Joined Dec 23, 2015 Messages 5,105 Location Australia Aug 6, 2023 #13 I'd have to check the floppies when I get home. You could always just use the standard Solos personality module. I seem to warm to original standard systems as they are often better documented and less buggy than \"souped up\" versions from smaller vendors and there can be a price to pay, for example no tape interface. I made replicas of the modules I liked using MM5204 UVeproms, which was possible because Martin Eberhard made an ME5204 ROM programmer. But I used my two spare modules up on the Three Brains project. Still, they come up on ebay from time to time. The SOL-20 keyboard is very fussy about the nature of the pads. As noted the pads which appear to give a universally good result are from the Sun-4 keyboard.

It will be complicated in my case: I don’t have another personality module, and even if I had one, the micro complex board implies some modification on the motherboard (trace cutting and soldering).

Transmission works fine, but there's a problem: the \"EN\" command used to tell the SOL-20 to write each line to the correct memory address... doesn't exist in the Micro Complex Person","question":null,"answer":null},{"id":null,"source":"https://forum.vcfed.org/index.php?threads/sol-20-memory-map.1244092/","content":"ality Module. In fact, it's not only the K7 commands that are missing from this damned module, the EN and DUMP commands are also absent. I've managed to substitute the new \"FM\" command found in the Micro Complex Personality Module brochure, but you have to put it before each line (a pain). Then, looking at the Personality Module documentation, I saw that it was possible to put a SOLOS ROM in the place of one of the two ROMs, which would theoretically allow me to recover a \"stock\" machine. Except that I also have this other Micro Complex 64/80 card, which is attached directly to the motherboard. Has anyone ever used these Micro Complex cards and could tell me a bit more about them? In any case, I'm going to make a ROM with SOLOS and see what happens.

It is a version that has Solos and DPmon (the latter I have not used because Solos is so great) I'm a bit of a spare parts lunatic.I could look in my parts box. I could sell it, possibly, but you would have to PM me to discuss that. One other option, I could manufacture another replica using the MM5204 Uveproms (these are my favorite lovely vintage parts as the orphan nature of them seems so appealing) and I can program them with the Eberhard programmer, no other programmers can do them, but that would take a little time to organize. But, your plan sounds good to make a Solos ROM yourself. ( Just my opinion mind you; if it were my SOL-20 I would get rid of the hardware modifications and convert it to standard. The other thing I would do is clean up the IC pins and remove the oxides from them, check every single IC socket pin for spring tension using a test pin taken from a defunct IC and soldered to a small wire handle. Many Sols used TI brand IC sockets that grab the pin from side to side, on its thin side, rather than the flat, so it is the thin sides of the IC pins that require cleaning. If you look at some you may find a grey or black line on the sides of the IC pins where the dissimilar metals interacted, this needs to be scraped off. The other thing, is that is is worth replacing those pale blue CTS dip switches, at this age many have gone intermittent. I replace these with an IC socket and fit new low profile Omron switches that have a form factor like an IC. Otherwise intermittent faults, related to bad connections, can plaque the computer. If you do have to replace any TI sockets, there is one saving grace, the plastic shroud can be lifted away, and the pins removed one by one, before clearing the holes of solder with the sucker. This is a lot less stressful for the pcb). Last edited: Aug 9, 2023 G guibrush Member Joined May 3, 2023 Messages 40 Aug 9, 2023 #17 Thanks for your proposal for the personality module. Tonight, I'm going visiting a friend who can make me the SOLOS ROM, so I'll be able to test it. I'll keep you posted. As for bringing the machine back to its original state: that was my very first idea, but the problem is that to install this card, 30 chips had to be removed from the motherboard. And I don't have those chips, of course. So it's quite complicated to do. for the other work: yes, I think it will be necessary whatever happens. Thanks! H Hugo Holden Veteran Member Joined Dec 23, 2015 Messages 5,105 Location Australia Aug 10, 2023 #18 I see from the photo that another card was added with lots of chips on it. At least the chips in the SOL are easy to get and not expensive.

The only documentation I found about this card is there: https://deramp.com/downloads/mfe_archive/070-Books%20Newsletters%20and%20Magazines/Solus-Proteus/Proteus%20Vol04-04&06.pdf Yesterday, I went to my friend with my SOL and he burned me s SOLOS rom: the rom seems to boot correctly. I have a prompt, and I can use the EN and DUMP command! We changed the caps on the 64k memory expansion, tested all ICs and found that a 7425n chip is defective. Despite this chip being defective, I can obtain a positive memory test (under DPMON) on the two central memory bank, between 4000 and BFFF. The first bank (0000 3FFF) and the last bank (C000 FFFF) report errors. Removing the chip give errors on all banks. So, it's definitively related. Because the first bank from 0000 isn't working, loading .ent files fail. I'm looking now for this chip and hope that with a new one the whole memory board will work. On the pic you can see that I entered values in 0000 and that reading it back give another values, and on the other hand making the same on 4000 give back the correct values. There is a pic with the good memory test result too. This is where I am now. SOLOS boot, but for me it's still unclear if the .ent files can be executed correctly. Small question: does the programs in .ent format have to access the video ram or the rom directly? I'm asking this, because I'm failing to understand how SOLOS can display something when the memory RAM is hidden by the Micro Complex board.

There was no Micro Complex adapter board and there are the proper Sol-20 chips in almost all the sockets (I had to replace one chip as it was not correct), but I'm hoping my board can be brought back to life without too much expense. . 1 2 3 4 5 Next 1 of 5 Go to page Go Next Last You must log in or register to reply here.

Out of the conjunction, it can then replay and reconstruct. Question: How does the brain record memories? Antonio Damasio: In classical ideas about how the memory records memories of events, for example, there’s the idea that the brain processes a sequence of signals and the signals come from the perceptual regions of the brain and they sort of go in one direction to higher and higher order regions of the brain, like for example, the interior temporal lobe or the interior frontal lobe. And it is there at that point that the... both, the most complex perceptions of complex events as well as the most complex memories of complex events are formed. So, the idea is that if you are listening to somebody singing or talking and at the same time seeing the person and sort of feeling yourself sitting in a chair because you are in a concert hall, that those separate impressions are only going to come together in very high order regions of the brain and that’s where they are going to be perceived, so that’s where you’ll have your sort of, film experience with soundtrack and whatnot. And that’s also where the recording is going to be made. And there are a lot of reasons why this cannot work this way. About 20 years ago we were dealing with this problem in that we proposed the framework in which we said, \"Well, first of all, we now are beginning to know that everything that moves forward in terms of signaling in the brain, does not move just in a forward direction, but as it moves forward, there’s also a feedback loop that comes to the origin of the feed forward.\" So, basically, we’re dealing with loops that advance, but also can come back on their tracks to the original point. That was something that was beginning to be known and that was very interesting because it opened up possibilities about the circuitry. So this is not just in one direction, but in multiple directions that included both the forward and the backward. And the other thing is that there was clear evidence that when you lose, as a result of damage to the brain, when you lose regions of the brain that are very high up, like interior temporal lobe, or interior frontal lobe, lo and behold, you don’t lose the possibility of having a complex perception of the world. In other worlds, your filmic experience still remains. Nor do you lose the possibility of remembering the complex perception. In fact the only thing you lose is the possibility of dating and recognizing the uniqueness of the perception. So, that discrepancy led us to propose this idea that there was a system of convergence that went over multiple hierarchies towards certain anchor points in the brain and that what the convergence was achieving was leading signals to a certain point, the convergence/divergence zone, and what was being recorded there was not all that was happening in your filmic experience, but rather the fact that something had happened back here that had happened simultaneously in this region, this region and this region. And then by dint of the feedback, the backward projection, we would have the possibility later on of the reactivating of the entire experience. Now, what this achieved—that’s the notion of convergence/divergence zone. I actually only first called convergence, and I remember Francis Crick telling me, “Don’t call it just convergence, that’s what people are going to remember, they will never think about the divergence part.” And then I later corrected this because he was quite right. And so, the idea is that when you are asked to remember a certain experience that you had today in which you’re talking with person A, listening to the person’s voice, but you also are in a certain context, B, which is the context of a certain room in a certain building. You are going to have the separate recordings of the voice of the person, the sight of the person, the place—but those recordings are going to be reactivated only if another recording of the simultaneity of the event has been made in a convergence/divergence zone. And so, you send signals forward through convergence and then divergence will allow for what I call, the process of retro-activation. And the retro-activation is going to take place in different sites at the same time, approximately, or in rapid sequence at those different places. Like for example, when we replay music in our minds. And so what this does, just to finalize the story, is create a... solve a great problem of economy. In other words, instead of having to record every event that you are going through in your life every day with every kind of person, with the books you read, the things you see and hear and touch and smell, what you need to do is record conjunctions of the occurrence of certain events. And then out of the conjunction, you can replay, you can reconstruct. And so, memory in this perspective is always reconstructive. You’re always trying to get at some approximation of what went on rather than an exact recording of what went on. And that’s where the big difference between the recording in terms of a photograph or in terms of the celluloid picture comes. We are not like that. We don’t have these... all of this celluloid or polaroid pictures filed in some place and we don’t just replay them in a screening room. We have something that is at least both far more complex, but at the same time far more economic and also to a certain extent because of its fragmented nature, far more prone to error. All of these things come into the picture.

Particularly Exciting Experiments in Psychology October 26, 2017 Allocating Visual Working Memory Resources Visual working memory is a cognitive system that maintains a limited amount of visual information so that it can be quickly accessed to serve the needs of ongoing tasks. How much information an individual can hold in visual working memory (visual working memory capacity) is found to be a stable trait that is predictive of general intelligence and a broad suite of cognitive abilities, and the precision and consolidation of visual working memory representations has been shown to be impaired in those with psychiatric disorders. Despite its central role in human cognition, exactly how limited resources are allocated in visual working memory remains an open question. Dube and colleagues (2017, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance) asked participants to memorize the colors in a memory array of 2 circles and 2 squares. Following a brief delay, one of the shapes was probed, and participants had to indicate the color of a probed shape and location by selecting the color on a color wheel. Critically, participants were told that one shape (squares or circles) were more likely to be probed, and across blocks participants were also told the likelihood that the high-probability shape would be probed (60%, 70%, 80% or 90%). Memory error (angular distance between color of the probed item and participant's response) for high-probability items decreased as the probability that the probed shape would be the high-probability shape increased. Thus, the value of the feature-based goal affected the likelihood that high-probability targets were encoded and recalled. Moreover, the probe probabilities also influenced guess rates, non-target responses, and memory precision as calculated by mixture and variable precision models. The authors interpret these results to suggest that in addition to simple filtering of targets vs. distractors for encoding, feature-based attention redistributes limited visual working memory resources across items according to the observer's goal (in this case, according to the relative likelihood of being probed). Dube and colleagues showed that feature-based attention can be used to modulate the deployment of visual working memory resources according to participant goals. Ye and colleagues (2017, Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition) examined the conditions under which such strategic resource allocation is possible. Participants were shown a memory array of oriented gratings, and after a delay were asked to indicate the orientation of a probed grating location. Points earned varied to create two precision conditions: In the high-precision condition, participants earned 6 points if their orientation response was offset from the true orientation by less than 10 degrees; in the low-precision condition participants earned 4 points if their response was offset by less than 30 degrees. When the memory array was presented for only 200 milliseconds and included 4 items, there was no difference in precision or number of items stored between precision conditions. However, when there were only two items in the memory array, memory precision was higher in the high-precision condition. Furthermore, when the memory array included 4 items but encoding time was increased to 500 milliseconds, precision was higher but the number of stored items was lower in the high vs. low precision condition. The authors suggest that allocation of visual working memory resources is initially involuntary and stimulus driven, but can become voluntary and flexible based on task requirements given sufficient time.

It facilitates planning, comprehension, reasoning, and problem-solving. I examine the historical roots and conceptual development of the concept and the theoretical and practical implications of current debates about working memory mechanisms. Then I explore the nature of cognitive developmental improvements in working memory, the role of working memory in learning, and some potential implications of working memory and its development for the education of children and adults. The use of working memory is quite ubiquitous in human thought, but the best way to improve education using what we know about working memory is still controversial. I hope to provide some directions for research and educational practice. What is Working Memory? An Introduction and Review Working memory is the small amount of information that can be held in mind and used in the execution of cognitive tasks, in contrast with long-term memory, the vast amount of information saved in one’s life. Working memory is one of the most widely-used terms in psychology. It has often been connected or related to intelligence, information processing, executive function, comprehension, problem-solving, and learning, in people ranging from infancy to old age and in all sorts of animals. This concept is so omnipresent in the field that it requires careful examination both historically and in terms of definition, to establish its key characteristics and boundaries. By weaving together history, a little philosophy, and empirical work in psychology, in this opening section I hope to paint a clear picture of the concept of working memory. In subsequent sections, implications of working memory for cognitive development, learning, and education will be discussed in turn, though for these broad areas it is only feasible to touch on certain examples. Some researchers emphasize the possibility of training working memory to improve learning and education. In this chapter, I take the complementary view that we must learn how to adjust the materials to facilitate learning and education with the working memory abilities that the learner has. Organizing knowledge, for example, reduces one’s memory load because the parts don’t have to be held in mind independently. Take, for example, the possibility of doing some scouting ahead so that you will know what this article is about, making your task of reading easier. If you tried to read through the headings of this article, you might have trouble remembering them (placing them all in working memory) so as to anticipate how they fit together. If you read Figure 1, though, it is an attempt to help you organize the information. If it helps you associate the ideas to one another to build a coherent framework, it should help you read by reducing the working-memory load you experience while reading. In doing so, you are building a rich structure to associate the headings with one another in long-term memory (e.g., Ericsson & Kintsch, 1995), which reduces the number of ideas that would have to be held independently in working memory in order to remember the organization. Open in a separate window Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the arguments in the present article. Early History of Working Memory Research In 1690, John Locke distinguished between contemplation, or holding an idea in mind, and memory, or the power to revive an idea after it has disappeared from the mind (Logie, 1996). The holding in mind is limited to a few concepts at once and reflects what is now called working memory, as opposed to the possibly unlimited store of knowledge from a lifetime that is now called long-term memory. Working memory can be defined as the small amount of information that can be held in an especially accessible state and used in cognitive tasks. Philosophers have long been interested in the limits of what can be contemplated, as noted by a leading British economist and logician, William Stanley Jevons. In an article in Science in 1871, he mused (p. 281): “It is well known that the mind is unable through the eye to estimate any large number of objects without counting them successively. A small number, for instance three or four, it can certainly comprehend and count by an instantaneous and apparently single act of mental attention.” Then he devised a little experiment to test this hypothesis, on himself. On each trial, he casually reached into a jar full of beans, threw several beans onto a table, and tried to estimate their number without counting. After 1,027 trials, he made no errors for sets of 3 or 4 beans, with some small errors for sets of 5 beans, and with increasing magnitudes of error as a function of set size thereafter, up to 15 beans. Despite the problematic nature of the method (in that the bean thrower was also the bean judge), the finding that normal adults typically can keep in mind only about 3 or 4 items has been replicated many times in modern research, using methods similar to Jevons (e.g., Mandler & Shebo, 1982) and using many other methods (Cowan, 2001). The limited amount that could be held in mind at once played an important role in early experimental psychology, e.g., in the early experimental work of Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885/1913) and Wilhelm Wundt (1894/1998). On the American front, William James (1890) wrote about a distinction between primary memory, the items in consciousness and the trailing edge of what is perceived in the world, and secondary memory, the items in storage but not currently in consciousness. Recent investigators have considered multiple possible reasons why primary memory might be limited to just a few items at once, including biological accounts based on the need to avoid confusion between concurrent objects in memory, and evolutionary and teleological accounts based on ideas about what capacity might be ideal for learning and memory retrieval (Cowan, 2010; Sweller, 2011), but as yet the reason is unknown. Ubiquity of the Working Memory Concept When we say that working memory holds a small amount of information, by this term we may be referring to something as abstract as ideas that can be contemplated, or something as concrete as objects that can be counted (e.g., beans). The main point of information is that it is the choice of some things out of a greater set of possible things. One of the exciting aspects of working memory is that it may be important on so many different levels, and in so many different situations. When you are listening to language, you need to retain information about the beginning of the sentence until you can make sense of it. If you hear Jean would like to visit the third building on the left you need to recall that the actor in the sentence is Jean. Then you need to retain the verb until you know what it is she would like to visit, and you need to retain the adjective “third” until you know, third what; and all of the pieces must be put together in the right way. Without sufficient working memory, the information would be lost before you could combine it into a coherent, complete thought. As another example of how working memory is used, when doing simple arithmetic in your head, if you want to add 24 and 18 you may need to find that 4+8=12, retain the 2 while carrying the 1 over to the tens column to make 2+1+1=4 in the tens column, and integrate with the ones columns to arrive at the answer, 42. As a third example, if you are searching for your car in a parking lot, you have to remember the layout of the cars in the region you just searched so that you can avoid wasting time searching the same region again. In the jungle, a predator that turns its vision away from a scene and revisits it moments later may use working memory to detect that something in the scene has shifted; this change detection may indicate the presence of prey. So the information in working memory can range from spoken words and printed digits to cars and future meals. It can even encompass abstract ideas. Consider whether a young child can get a good understanding of what is or is not a tiger (a matter of word category concepts, e.g., Nelson, 1974; Saltz, Soller, & Sigel, 1972). The concept is, in lay terms, a big cat with stripes. It excludes lions, which have no stripes, and it excludes zebras, which are not big cats. The child must be able to keep in mind the notion of a cat and the notion of stripes at the same time in order to grasp the tiger concept correctly. If the child thinks only of the stripes, he or she may incorrectly label a zebra as a tiger. The concept presumably starts out in working memory and, once it is learned, is transferred to long-term memory. At first, an incomplete concept might be stored in long-term memory, leading to misconceptions that are corrected later when discrepancies with further input are noticed and working memory is used to amend the concept in long-term memory. On a more abstract plane, there are more semantic issues mastered somewhat later in childhood (e.g., Clark & Garnica, 1974). The concept of bringing something seems to require several conditions: the person doing the bringing must have something at a location other than the speaker’s location (or future planned location), and must accompany that thing to the speaker’s location. You can ask the person to bring a salad to your house, but probably not to take a salad to your house (unless you are not there), and not to send a salad to your house (unless they are not coming along). These conditions can tax working memory. Again, the child’s initial concept transferred from working memory to long-term memory may be incomplete, and amended later when discrepancies with further input are noticed. Working Memory: The Past 64 Years There are several modern beginnings for the working memory concept. Hebb (1949) had an outlook on temporary memory that was more neurologically based than the earlier concept of primary memory of James (1890). He spoke of ideas as mediated by assemblies of cells firing in a specific pattern for each idea or concept, and only a few cell assemblies would be active, with current neural firing, at any moment. This vision has played an important rol","question":null,"answer":null},{"id":null,"source":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/","content":"e in the field. An issue that is raised by this work is whether working memory should be identified with all of the active information that can be used in immediate memory tests, whether conscious or not, or whether it should be reserved to describe only the conscious information, more in the flavor of James. Given that working memory is a term usually used to explain behavioral outcomes rather than subjective reports, it is typically not restricted to conscious primary memory (e.g., see Baddeley, 1986; Baddeley & Hitch, 1974; Cowan, 1988). Cowan explicitly suggested that there are two aspects of working memory storage: (1) the activated portion of long-term memory, perhaps corresponding to Hebb’s active cell assemblies, and (2) within that activated portion, a smaller subset of items in the focus of attention. The activated memory would consist of a fragmented soup of all kinds of activated features (sensory, phonological, orthographic, spatial, and semantic), whereas the focus of attention would contain just a few well-integrated items or chunks. Contributions of George Miller Miller (1956) discussed the limitation in how many items can be held in immediate memory. In the relevant test procedure, a list of items is seen or heard and immediately afterward (that is, with no imposed retention interval), the list must be repeated verbatim. The ability to do so was said to be limited to about seven chunks, where a chunk is a meaningful unit. For example, the random digit list 582931 may have to be encoded initially as six chunks, one per digit, whereas the sequence 123654 probably can be encoded by most adults as only two chunks (an ascending triplet followed by a descending triplet). Subsequent work has suggested that the number seven is a practical result that emerges on the basis of strategies that participants use and that, when it is not possible to use chunking or covert verbal rehearsal to help performance, adults typically can retain only 3 or 4 pre-existing chunks (Chen & Cowan, 2009; Cowan, 2001; Cowan, Rouder, Blume, & Saults, 2012; Luck & Vogel, 1997; Rouder et al., 2008). The first mention I have found of the term working memory comes from a book by Miller, Galanter, and Pribram (1960), Plans and the structure of behavior. The title itself, and the concept of organization, seems reminiscent of the earlier work by Hebb (1949), The organization of behavior. Miller et al. observed that daily functioning in the world requires a hierarchy of plans. For example, your plan to do well at work requires a sub-plan to be there at time in the morning, which in turn may require sub-plans to eat breakfast, shower, get dressed, gather work materials, and so on. Each of these plans also may have sub-plans, and you may have competing plans (such as choosing an after-work activity, calling your mother, or acquiring food for dinner). Our working memory was said to be the mental faculty whereby we remember the plans and sub-plans. We cannot think about all of them at once but we might, for example, keep in mind that the frying pan is hot while retrieving a knife from the drawer, and we may keep bringing to mind the approximate time so as not to be late. Working memory was said to be the facility that is used to carry out one sub-plan while keeping in mind the necessary related sub-plans and the master plan. Contributions of Donald Broadbent In Great Britain, Broadbent’s (1958) book helped to bring the conversation out of the behaviorist era and into an era of cognitive psychology. In a footnote within the book, he sketched a rough information processing diagram that showed information progressing from a sensory type of store that holds a lot of information briefly, through an attention filter to essentially a working memory that holds only a few items, to a long-term memory that is our storehouse of knowledge accumulated through a lifetime. The empirical basis for the model came largely from his work with selective attention, including many dichotic listening studies in which the task was to listen to the message from one ear and ignore the message from the other ear, or report both messages in some order. The motivation for this kind of research came largely from practical issues provoked by World War II, such as how to help a pilot listen to his own air traffic control message while ignoring messages meant for other pilots but presented in the same channel. An important theoretical outcome, however, was the discovery of a difference between a large-capacity but short-lived sensory memory that was formed regardless of attention, and a longer-lived but small-capacity abstract working memory that required attention. Contributions of Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch Miller et al. (1960) may have devised the term working memory but they were not the predominant instigator of the work that has occurred subsequently in the field. Google Scholar does show it with over 5,600 citations. A chapter by Baddeley and Hitch (1974), though, is listed with over 7,400 citations and a 1992 Science article summarizing that approach has over 14,500 citations. In the 1974 chapter, the term working memory was used to indicate a system of temporary memory that is multifaceted, unlike the single store such as James’ primary memory, or the corresponding box in Broadbent’s (1958) model, or an elaborated version of it as in the model of Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) model, none of which would do. In fact, a lot of investigators in the 1960’s proposed variations of information processing models that included a single short-term memory store, and Baddeley often has referred to these together, humorously, as the “modal model,” providing a sketch of it with sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory boxes as in the Broadbent and the Atkinson/Shiffrin models. (When the humor and the origin of the phrase “modal model” are forgotten, yet the phrase is still widely used, it seems sad somehow.) The main point emphasized by Baddeley and Hitch (1974) is that there were diverse effects that appeared to implicate short-term memory, but that did not converge to a single component. Phonological processing interfered most with phonological storage, visual-spatial processing interfered with visual-spatial storage, and a working memory load did not seem to interfere much with superior memory for the end of a list, or recency effect. Conceptual learning did not depend heavily on the type of memory that was susceptible to phonological similarity effects, and a patient with a very low memory span was still able to learn new facts. To account for all of the dissociations, they ended up concluding that there was an attention-related control system and various storage systems. These included a phonological system that also included a covert verbal rehearsal process, and a visual-spatial storage system that might have its own type of non-verbal rehearsal. In the 1974 version of the theory, there were attention limits on the storage of information as well as on processing. In a 1986 book, Baddeley eliminated the attention-dependent storage but in a 2000 paper, a new component was added in the form of an episodic buffer. This buffer might or might not be attention-dependent and is responsible for holding semantic information for the short term, as well as the specific binding or association between phonological and visual-spatial information. Baddeley and Hitch called the assembly or system of storage and processing in service of holding information in an accessible form working memory, the memory one uses in carrying out cognitive tasks of various kinds (i.e., cognitive work). Model of Cowan (1988) Through the years, there were several other proposals that alter the flavor of the working memory proposal. Cowan (1988) was concerned with how we represent what we know and do not know about information processing. The “modal models” of which Baddeley has spoken began with Broadbent’s (1958) model in which the boxes were shown to be accessed in sequence, comparable to a computer flow chart: first sensory memory, then an attention filter, then short-term memory, and then long-term memory. Atkinson & Shiffrin (1968) preserved the flow chart structure but added recursive entry into the boxes, in the form of the control processes. Baddeley and Hitch (1974) and Baddeley (1986) instead used a processing diagram in which the boxes could be accessed in parallel. One presumably could enter some information into phonological storage while concurrently entering other information into visual-spatial storage, with interacting modules and concurrent executive control. Cowan (1988, 1995, 1999, 2001, 2005) recoiled a bit from the modules and separate boxes, partly because they might well form an arbitrarily incomplete taxonomy of the systems in the brain. (Where would spatial information about sound go? Where would touch information go? These types of unanswered questions also may have helped motivate the episodic buffer of Baddeley, 2000.) There could be multiple modules, but because we do not know the taxonomy, they were all thrown into the soup of activated long-term memory. Instead of separate boxes, I attempted to model on a higher level at which distinctions that were incomplete were not explicitly drawn into the model, and mechanisms could be embedded in other mechanisms. Thus, there was said to be a long-term memory, a subset of which was in an activated state (cf. Hebb, 1949), and within that, a smaller subset of which was in the focus of attention (cf. James, 1890). Dissociations could still occur on the basis of similarity of features; two items with phonological features will interfere with one another, for example, more than one item with phonological features and another item with only visual-spatial features. The model still included central executive processes. Compared to Baddeley and Hitch (1974), Cowan (1988) also placed more emphasis on sensory memory. It is true that printed letters, like spoken letters, are encoded with speech-based, phonological features that can be confused with each other in working memory (e.g., Conrad, 1964). Nevertheless, there is abundant other evidence that lists presented in a spoken form are remembered much better, in particular at the end of the list, than verbal lists presented in printed form (e.g., Murdock & Walker, 1969; Penney, 1989). The attention filter also was internalized in the model of Cowan (1988). Instead of information having to pass through a filter, it was assumed that all information activates long-term memory to some degree. The mind forms a neural model of what it has processed. This will include sensory information for all stimuli but, in the focus of attention, much more semantic information than one finds for unattended information. Incoming information that matches the current neural model becomes habituated, but changes that are perceived cause dishabituation in the form of attentional orienting responses toward the dishabituated stimuli (cf. Sokolov, 1963). Such a system has properties similar to the attenuated filtering model of Treisman (1960) or the pertinence model of Normal (1968). Attention is controlled in this view dually, often with a struggle between voluntary executive control and involuntary orienting responses. How consistent is Cowan (1988) with the Baddeley and Hitch model? Contributions of Robert Logie With the addition of the episodic buffer, the model of Baddeley and Hitch makes predictions that are often similar to those of Cowan (1988). There still may be important differences, though. An open question is whether the activated portion of long-term memory of Cowan (1988) functionally serves the same purpose as the phonological and visual-spatial buffers of Baddeley and Hitch (1974) and Baddeley (1986). Robert Logie and colleagues argue that this cannot be, inasmuch as visual imagery and visual short-term memory are dissociated (Borst, Niven, & Logie, 2012; Logie & van der Meulen, 2009; van der Meulen, Logie, & Della Sala, 2009). Irrelevant visual materials interfere with the formation of visual imagery but not with visual storage, whereas tapping in a spatial pattern interferes with visual storage but not the formation of visual images. According to the model that these sources put forward, visual imagery involves activation of long-term memory representations, whereas visual short-term storage is a separate buffer. Although this is a poss","question":null,"answer":null},{"id":null,"source":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/","content":"ibility that warrants further research, I am not yet convinced. There could be other reasons for the dissociation. For example, in the study of van der Meulen et al., the visual imagery task involved detecting qualities of the letters presented (curved line or not, enclosed space or not, etc.) and these qualities could overlap more with the picture interference; whereas the visual memory task involved remembering letters in upper and lower case visually, in the correct serial order, and the serial order property may suffer more interference from tapping in a sequential spatial pattern. Testing of the generality of the effects across tasks with different features is needed. Other models of cross-domain generality One difference between the Baddeley (1986) framework and that of Cowan (1988) was that Cowan placed more emphasis on the possibility of interference between domains. There has been a continuing controversy about the extent to which verbal and nonverbal codes in working memory interfere with one another (e.g., Cocchini, Logie, Della Sala, MacPherson, & Baddeley, 2002; Cowan & Morey, 2007; Fougnie & Marois, 2011; Morey & Bieler, 2013). The domain-general view has extended to other types of research. Daneman and Carpenter (1980) showed that reading and remembering words are tasks that interfere with one another, with the success of remembering in the presence of reading a strong correlate of reading comprehension ability. Engle and colleagues (e.g., Engle, Tuholski, Laughlin, & Conway, 1999; Kane et al., 2004) showed that this sort of effect does not just occur with verbal materials, but occurs even with storage and processing in separate domains, such as spatial recall with verbal memory. They attributed individual differences primarily to the processing tasks and the need to hold in mind task instructions and goals while suppressing irrelevant distractions. Barrouillet and colleagues (e.g., Barrouillet, Portrat, & Camos, 2011; Vergauwe, Barrouillet, & Camos, 2010) emphasized that the process of using attention to refresh items, no matter whether verbal or nonverbal in nature, takes time and counteracts decay. They provided complex tasks involving concurrent storage and processing, like Daneman and Carpenter and like Engle and colleagues. The key measure is cognitive load, the proportion of time that is taken up by the processing task rather than being free for the participant to use to refresh the representations of items to be remembered. The finding of Barrouillet and colleagues has been that the effect of cognitive load on the length of list that can be recalled, or memory span, is a negative linear (i.e., deleterious) effect. They do also admit that there is a verbal rehearsal process that is separate from attentional refreshing, with the option of using either mode of memory maintenance depending on the task demands (Camos, Mora, & Oberauer, 2011), but there is more emphasis on attentional refreshing than in the case of Baddeley and colleagues, and the approach therefore seems more in keeping with Cowan (1988) with its focus of attention (regarding refreshing see also Cowan, 1992). Ongoing controversies about the nature of working-memory memory limits There are theoretically two basic ways in which working memory could be more limited than long-term memory. First, It could be limited in terms of how many items can be held at once, a capacity limit that Cowan (1998, 2001) tentatively ascribes to the focus of attention. Second, it could be limited in the amount of time for which an item remains in working memory when it is no longer rehearsed or refreshed, a decay limit that Cowan (1988) ascribed to the activated portion of long-term memory, the practical limit being up to about 30 seconds depending on the task. Both of these limits are currently controversial. Regarding the capacity limit, there is not much argument that, within a particular type of stimulus coding (phonological, visual-spatial, etc.), normal adults are limited to about 3 or 4 meaningful units or chunks. The debate is whether the limit occurs in the focus of attention, or because materials of similar sorts interfere with one another (e.g., Oberauer, Lewandowsky, Farrell, Jarrold, & Greaves, 2012). In my recent, still-unpublished work, I suggest that the focus of attention is limited to several chunks of information, but that these chunks can be off-loaded to long-term memory and held there, with the help of some attentional refreshing, while the focus of attention is primarily used to encode additional information. Regarding the memory loss or decay limit, some studies have shown no loss of information for lists of printed verbal materials across periods in which rehearsal and refreshing have apparently been prevented (Lewandowsky, Duncan, & Brown, 2004; Oberauer & Lewandowsky, 2008). Nevertheless, for arrays of unfamiliar characters followed by a mask to eliminate sensory memory, Ricker and Cowan (2010) did find memory loss or decay (cf. Zhang & Luck, 2009). In further work, Ricker et al. (in press) suggested that the amount of decay depends on how well the information is consolidated in working memory (cf. Jolicoeur & Dell'Acqua, 1998). Given that the time available for refreshing appeared to be inversely related to the cognitive load, the consolidation process that seems critical is not interrupted by a mask but continues after it. This consolidation process could be some sort of strengthening of the episodic memory trace based on attentional refreshing in the spirit of Barrouillet et al. (2011). If so, the most important effect of this refreshing would not be to reverse the effects of decay temporarily, as Barrouillet et al. proposed, but rather to alter the rate of decay itself. Our plans for future research include investigation of these possibilities. Long-term working memory It is clear that people function quite well in complex environments in which detailed knowledge must be used in an expert manner, despite a severe limit in working memory to a few ideas or items at once. What is critical in understanding this paradox of human performance is that each slot in working memory can be filled with a concept of great complexity, provided that the individual has the necessary knowledge in long-term memory. This point was made by Miller (1956) in his concept of combining items to form larger chunks of information, with the limit in working memory found in the number of chunks, not the number of separate items presented for memorization. Ericsson and Kintsch (1995) took this concept further by expanding the definition of working memory to include relevant information in long-term memory. Although we might quibble about the best definition of working memory, it seems undeniable that long-term memory is often used as Ericsson and Kintsch (1995) suggest. An example is what happens when one is holding a conversation with a visitor that is interrupted by a telephone call. During the call, the personal conversation with one’s visitor is typically out of conscious working memory. After the call, however, with the visitor serving as a vivid cue, it is often possible to retrieve a memory of the conversation as a recent episode and to remember where this conversation left off. That might not be possible some days later. This use of long-term memory to serve a function similar to the traditional working memory, thus expanding the person’s capabilities, was termed long-term working memory by Ericsson and Kintsch. Cowan (1995) alluded to a similar use of long-term memory for this purpose but, not wanting to expand the definition of working memory, called the function virtual short-term memory, meaning a use of long-term memory in a way that short-term memory is usually used. It is much like the use of computer memory that allows the computer to be turned off in hibernation mode and later returned to its former state when the memory is retrieved. Given the ability of humans to use long-term memory so adeptly, one could ask why we care about the severe working memory capacity limit at all. The answer is that it is critical when there is limited long-term knowledge of the topic. In such circumstances, the capacity of working memory can determine how many items can be held in mind at once in order to use the items together, or to link them to form a new concept in long-term memory. This is the case in many situations that are important for learning and comprehension. One simple example of using items together is following a set of instructions, e.g., to a preschool child, put your drawing in your cubby and then go sit in the circle. Part of that instruction may be forgotten before it is carried out and teachers must be sensitive to that possibility. A simple example of linking items together is in reading a novel, when one listens to a description of a character and melds the parts of the description to arrive at an overall personality sketch that can be formed in long-term memory. Inadequate use of working memory during reading may lead to the sketch being incomplete, as some descriptive traits are inadvertently ignored. Knowledge of this working memory limit can be used to improve one’s writing by making it easier to remember and comprehend. Paas and Sweller (2012) bring up the distinction between biologically primary and secondary knowledge (Geary, 2008) and suggest (p. 29) that “Humans are easily able to acquire huge amounts of biologically primary knowledge outside of educational contexts and without a discernible working memory load.” Examples they offered were the learning of faces and learning to speak. It may well be the case that individual faces or spoken words quickly become integrated chunks in long-term memory (and, I would add, the same seems true for objects in domains of learned expertise, e.g., written words in adults). Nevertheless, the biologically-primary components are used in many situations in which severe capacity limits do apply. In these situations, the added memory demand is considered biologically secondary. An example is learning which face should be associated with which name. If four novel faces are shown on a screen and their names are vocally presented, these name-face pairs cannot be held in working memory at once, so it is difficult to retain the information and it often takes additional study of one pair at a time to remember the name-face pairing. Specific mathematical models Here I have been selective in examining models of working memory that are rather overarching and verbally specified. By limiting the domain of applicability and adding some processing assumptions, other researchers throughout the years have been able to formulate models that make mathematical predictions of performance in specific situations. We have learned a lot from them but they are essentially outside of the scope of this review given limited space and given my own limitations. For examples of such models see Brown, Neath, & Chater, 2007; Burgess & Hitch, 1999; Cowan et al., 2012; Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2002; Hensen, 1998; Murdock, 1982; Oberauer & Lewandowsky, 2011). The importance of these models is that they make clear the consequences of our theoretical assumptions. In order to make quantitative predictions, each mathematical assumption must be made explicit. It is sometimes found that the effects of certain proposed mechanisms, taken together, are not what one might assume from a purely verbal theory. Of course, some of the assumptions that one must make to eke out quantitative predictions may be unsupported, so I believe that the best way forward in the field is to use general verbal, propositional thinking some of the time and specific quantitative modeling other times, working toward a convergence of these methods toward a common theory. Summary: Status of Working Memory The progress in this field might be likened to an upward spiral. We make steady progress but meanwhile, we go in circles. The issues of the nature of working memory limits have not changed much from the early days. Why is the number of items limited? Why is the duration limited? What makes us forget? How is it related to the conscious mind and to neural processes? These questions are still not answered. At the same time, we have agreement about what can be found in particular circumstances. Set up the stimuli one way, and there is interference between modalities. Set it up another way and there appears to be ","question":null,"answer":null},{"id":null,"source":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/","content":"much less interference. Set it up one way and items are lost rapidly across time. Set it up a different way, and there is much less loss. There are brain areas associated with the focus of attention and with working memory across modalities (Cowan, 2011; Cowan, Li et al., 2011; Todd & Marois, 2004; Xu & Chun, 2006). This is progress awaiting an adequate unifying theory. What we do know has practical implications. To avoid overtaxing an individual’s working-memory capabilities, one should avoid presenting more than a few items or ideas at once, unless the items can be rapidly integrated. One should also avoid making people hold on to unintegrated information for a very long time. For example, I could write a taxing sentence like, It is said that, if your work is not overwhelming, your car is in good repair, and the leaves have changed color, it is a good time for a fall vacation. However, that sentence requires a lot from the reader’s working memory. I could reduce the working memory load by not making you wait for the information that provides the unifying theme, keeping the working memory load low: It is said that a good time for a fall vacation is when your work is not overwhelming, your car is in good repair, and the leaves have changed color. Working Memory and Cognitive Development There is no question that working-memory capabilities increase across the life span of the individual. In early tests of maturation (e.g., Bolton, 1892), and to this day in tests of intelligence, children have been asked to repeat lists of random digits. The length of list that can be successfully repeated on some predefined proportion of trials is the digit span. It increases steadily with childhood maturation, until late childhood. When the complexity of the task is increased, the time to adult-like performance is extended a bit further, with steady improvement throughout childhood (for an example see Gathercole, Pickering, Ambridge, & Wearing, 2004). As we saw in the introductory section, clear practical findings do not typically come with a clear understanding of the theoretical explanation. There have been many explanations over the years for the finding of increasing memory span with age (e.g., see Bauer & Fivush, in press; Courage & Cowan, 2009; Kail, 1990). These explanations may lead to differing opinions of the best course for learning and education, as well. Explanations Based on Capacity Explanations of intellectual growth based on working memory capacity stem from what has been called the neoPiagetian school of thought. Jean Piaget outlined a series of developmental stages, but with no known underlying reason for the progression between stages. Pascual-Leone and Smith (1969) attributed the developmental increases to increases in the number of items that could be held in mind at once. The theory becomes more explicit with the contributions of Halford, Phillips, and Wilson (1998) and Andrews and Halford (2002). They suggests that it is the number of associations between elements that is restricted and that this matters because it limits the complexity of thought. In my example above, the concept of a tiger versus lion versus zebra requires concurrent consideration of the animal’s shape and presence or absence of stripes. Similarly, addition requires the association between three elements: the two elements being added and the sum. A concept like bigger than is a logical relation requiring three slots, e.g., bigger than (dog, elephant). Ratios require the coordination of four elements (e.g., 4/6 is equivalent to 6/9) and therefore are considerably harder to grasp, according to the theory (see Halford, Cowan, & Andrews, 2007). This concept is quite promising and might even appear to be “the only game in town” when it comes to trying to understand the age limits on children’s ability to comprehend ideas of various levels of complexity. One problem with it is that it is not always straightforward to determine the arity of a concept, or number of ideas that must be associated. For example, a young child might understand the concept big(elephant) and then might be able to infer that elephants are bigger than dogs, without being able to use the concept of bigger than in a consistent manner more generally. The concept from Miller (1956) that items can be combined using knowledge to form larger chunks also applies to associations, and it is not clear how to be sure that the level of complexity actually is what it is supposed to be. Knowledge allows some problems to be solved with less working memory requirement. Explanations Based on Knowledge It is beyond question that knowledge increases with age. Perhaps this knowledge increase is the sole reason for developmental change in working memory, it has been argued. Chi (1978) showed that children with an expertise in the game of chess could remember chess configurations better than adults with no such expertise. The expert children presumably could form larger chunks of chess pieces, greatly reducing the memory load. Case, Kurland, and Goldberg (1982) gave adults materials that were unfamiliar and found that both the speed of item identification and the memory span for those materials closely resembled what was found for 6-year-olds on familiar materials. The implication was that the familiarity with the materials determines the processing speed, which in turn determines the span. Explanations Based on Processing Speed and Strategies Case et al. (1982) talked of a familiarity difference leading to a speed difference. Others have suggested that, more generally, speed of processing increases with age in childhood and decrease again with old age (e.g., Kail & Salthouse, 1994). This has led to accounts of working memory improvement based on an increased rate of covert verbal rehearsal (Hulme & Tordoff, 1989) or increased rate of attentional refreshing (Barrouillet, Gavens, Vergauwe, Gaillard, & Camos, 2009; Camos & Barrouillet, 2011). At the lower end of childhood, it has been suggested on the basis of various evidence that young children do not rehearse at all (Flavell, Beach, & Chinsky, 1966; Garrity, 1975; Henry, 1991) or do not rehearse in a sufficiently sophisticated manner that is needed to assist in recall (Ornstein & Naus, 1978). When rehearsal aloud is required, the result suggest that the most recently rehearsed items are recalled best (Tan & Ward, 2000). This view that rehearsal is actually important has been opposed recently. It is not clear that rehearsal must be invoked to explain performance (Jarrold & Citroën, 2013) and if rehearsal takes place, it is not clear exactly what the internal processes are (e.g., cumulative repetition of the list? Repetition of each item as it is presented?). In the case of using attention to refresh information, an interesting case can be made. Children who are too young (about 4 years of age and younger) do not seem to use attention to refresh items. For them, the limit in performance depends on the duration of the retention interval. For older children and adults, who are able to refresh, it is not the absolute duration but the cognitive load that determines performance (Barrouillet et al., 2011). The “phase change” in performance that is observed here with the advent of refreshing is perhaps comparable to the phase change that is seen with the advent of verbal rehearsal (Henry, 1991), though the evidence may be stronger in the case of refreshing. Re-assessment of Capacity Accounts We have seen that there are multiple ways in which children’s working memory performance gets better with maturity. There are reasons to care about whether the growth of capacity is primary, or whether it is derived from some other type of development. For example, if the growth of capacity results only from the growth of knowledge, then it should be possible to teach any concept at any age, if the concept can be made familiar enough. If capacity differences come from speed differences, it might be possible to allow more time by making sure that the parts to be incorporated into a new concept are presented sufficiently slowly. We have done a number of experiments suggesting that there is something to capacity that changes independent of these other factors. Regarding knowledge, relevant evidence was provided by Cowan, Nugent, Elliott, Ponomarev, and Saults (1999) in their test of memory for digits that were unattended while a silent picture-rhyming game was carried out. The digits were attended only occasionally, when a recall cue was presented about 1 s after the last digit. The performance increase with age throughout the elementary school years was just as big for small digits (1, 2, 3), which are likely to be familiar, as for large digits (7, 8, 9), which are less familiar. Gilchrist, Cowan, and Naveh-Benjamin (2009) further examined memory for lists of unrelated, spoken sentences in order to distinguish between a measure of capacity and a measure of linguistic knowledge. The measure of capacity was an access rate, the number of sentences that were at least partly recalled. The measure of linguistic knowledge was a completion rate, the proportion of a sentence that was recalled, provided that at least part of it was recalled. This sentence completion rate was about 80% for both first and sixth grader children, suggesting that for these simple sentences, there was no age difference in knowledge. Nevertheless, the number of sentences accessed was considerably smaller in first-grade children than in sixth-grade children (about 2.5 sentences vs. 4 sentences). I conclude, tentatively at least, that knowledge differences cannot account for the age difference in working memory capacity. We have used a different procedure to help rule out a number of factors that potentially could underlie the age difference in observed capacity. It is based on a procedure that has been well-researched in adults (Luck & Vogel, 1997). On each trial of this procedure, an array of simple items (such as colored squares) is presented briefly and followed by a retention interval of about 1 s, and then a single probe item is presented. The latter is to be judged identical to the array item from the same location, or a new item. This task is convenient partly because there are mathematical ways to estimate the number of items in working memory (Cowan, 2001). If k items are in working memory and there are N items in the array, the likelihood that the probed item is known is k/N, and a correct response can also come from guessing. It is possible to calculate k, which for this procedure is equal to N(h-f), where h refers the proportion of change trials in which the change was detected (hits) and f refers to the proportion of no-change trials in which a change was incorrectly reported (false alarms). One possibility is that younger children remember less of the requested information because they attend to more irrelevant information, cluttering working memory (for adults, cf. Vogel, McCollough, & Machizawa, 2005). To examine this, Cowan, Morey, AuBuchon, Zwilling, and Gilchrist (2010) presented both colored circles and colored triangles and instructed participants to pay closer attention to one shape, which was tested on 80% of the trials in critical blocks. When there were 2 triangles and 2 circles, memory for the more heavily-attended shape was better than memory for the less-attended shape, to the same extent in children in Grades 1–2 and Grades 6–7, and in college students. Yet, the number of items in working memory was much lower in children in Grades 1–2 than in the two older groups. It did not seem that the inability to filter out irrelevant information accounted for the age difference in capacity. Another possibility is that in Cowan et al. (2010), the array items occurred too fast for the younger children to encode correctly. To examine this, Cowan, AuBuchon, Gilchrist, Ricker, & Saults (2011) presented the items one at a time at relatively slow, a 1-item-per-second rate. The results remained the same as before. In some conditions, the participant had to repeat each color as it was presented or else say “wait” to suppress rehearsal; this articulatory manipulation, too, left the developmental effect unchanged. It appears that neither encoding speed nor articulation could account for the age differences. So we believe that age differences in capacity may be primary rather than derived from another process. Age differences in capacity s","question":null,"answer":null},{"id":null,"source":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/","content":"till could occur because of age differences in the speed of a rapid process of refreshment, and from the absence of refreshment in young children (Camos & Barrouillet, 2011). Alternatively, it could occur because of age differences in some other type of speed, neural space, or efficiency. This remains to be seen but at least we believe that there is a true maturational change in working memory capacity underlying age differences in the ability to comprehend materials of different complexity. This is in addition to profound effects of knowledge acquisition and the ability to use strategies. The use of strategies themselves may be secondary to the available working memory resources to carry out those strategies. According to the neoPiagetian view of Pascual-Leone and Smith (1969), for example, the tasks themselves share resources with the data being stored. Cowan et al. (2010) found that when the size of the array to be remembered was large (3 more-relevant and 3 less-relevant items, rather than 2 of each) then young children were no longer able to allocate more attention to the more-relevant items. The attentional resource allocated to the items in the array was apparently deducted from the resource available to allocate attention optimally. In practical terms, it is worth remembering that several aspects of working memory are likely to develop: capacity, speed, knowledge, and the use of strategies. Although it is not always easy to know which process is primary, these aspects of development all should contribute in some way to our policies regarding learning and education. Working Memory and Learning In early theories of information processing, up through the current period, working memory was viewed as a portal to long-term memory. In order for information to enter long-term memory in a form that allows later retrieval, it first must be present in working memory in a suitable form. Sometimes that form appears modality-specific. For example, Baddeley, Papagno, and Vallar (1988) wondered how it could be that a patient with a very small verbal short-term memory span, 2 or 3 digits at most, could function so well in most ways and exhibit normal learning capabilities. The answer turned out to be that she displayed a very selective deficit: she was absolutely unable to learn new vocabulary. This finding led to a series of developmental studies showing that individual differences in phonological memory are quite important for differences in word-learning capability in both children and adults (Baddeley, Gathercole, & Papagno, 1998; Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989, 1990). Aside from this specific domain, there are several ways in which working memory can influence learning. It is important to have sufficient working memory for concept formation. The control processes and mnemonic strategies used with working memory also are critical to learning. Working Memory and Concept Formation Learning might be thought of in an educational context as the formation of new concepts. These new concepts occur when existing concepts are joined or bound together. Some of this binding is mundane. If an individual knows what the year 1776 means and also what the Declaration of Independence is (at least in enough detail to remember the title of the declaration), then it is possible to learn the new concept that the Declaration of Independence was written in the year 1776. Other times, the binding of concepts may be more interesting and there may be a new conceptual leap involved. For example, a striped cat is a tiger. As another simple example, to understand what a parallelogram is, the child has to understand what the word parallel means, and further to grasp that two sets of parallel lines intersect with one another. The ideas presumably must co-exist in working memory for the concept to be formed. For the various types of concept formation, then, the cauldron is assumed to be working memory. According to my own view, the binding of ideas occurs more specifically in the focus of attention. We have taken a first step toward verifying that hypothesis. Cowan, Donnell, and Saults (in press) presented lists of words with an incidental task: to report the most interesting word in each presented list. Later, participants completed a surprise test in which they were asked whether pairs of words came from the same list; the words were always one or two serial positions apart in their respective lists, but sometimes were from the same list and sometimes from different lists. The notion was that the link between the words in the same list would be formed only if the words had been in the focus of attention at the same time, which was much more likely for short lists than for long lists. In keeping with this hypothesis, performance was better for words from short lists of 3 items (about 59%) than for words from lists of 6 or 9 items (about 53%). This is a small effect, but it is still important that there was unintentional learning of the association between items that were together in the focus of attention just once, when there was no intention of learning the association. The theory of Halford et al. (1998) may be the best articulated theory suggesting why a good working memory is important for learning. (In this discussion, a “good” working memory is simply one that can keep in mind sufficient items and their relations to one another to solve the problem at hand, which may require a sufficient combination of capacity, speed, knowledge, and available strategies.) More complex concepts require that one consider the relationship between more parts. A person’s working memory can be insufficient for a complex concept. It may be possible to memorize that concept with less working memory, but not truly to understand the concept and work with it. Take, for example, use of the concept of transitivity in algebra. If a+b=c+d and c+d=e, then we can conclude that a+b=e because equality is transitive. Yet, a person who understands the rules of algebra still would not be able to draw the correct inference if that person could not concurrently remember the two equations. Even if the equations are side by side on the page, that does not mean that they necessarily can be encoded into working memory at the same time, which is necessary in order to draw the inference. Lining up the equations vertically for the learner and then inviting the learner to apply the rule by rote is a method that can be used to reduce the working memory load, perhaps allowing the problem to be solved. However, working out the problem that way will not necessarily produce the insight needed to set up a new problem and solve it, because setting up the problem correctly requires the use of working memory to understand what should be lined up with what. So if the individual does not have sufficient working memory capacity, a rote method of solution may be helpful for the time being. More importantly, though, the problem could be set up in a more challenging manner so that the learner is in the position of having to use his or her working memory to store the information. By doing so, the hope is that successful solution of the problem then will result in more insight that allows the application of the principles to other problems. That, in fact, is an expression of the issues that may lead to the use of word problems in mathematics education. Working Memory and Control Processes Researchers appear to be in fairly good agreement that one of the most important aspects of learning is staying on task. If one does not stick to the relevant goals, one will learn something perhaps, but it will not be the desired learning. Individuals who test well on working memory tasks involving a combination of storage and processing have been shown to do a better job staying on task. A good experimental example of how staying on task is tied to working memory is one carried out by Kane and Engle (2003) using a well-known task designed long ago by John Ridley Stroop. In the key condition within this task, one is to name the color of ink in which color words are written. Sometimes, the color of ink does not match the written color and there is a tendency to want to read the word instead of naming the color. This effect can be made more treacherous by presenting stimuli in which the word and color match on most trials, so that the participant may well lapse into reading and lose track of the correct task goal (naming the color of ink). What that happens, the result is an error or long delay on the occasional trials for which the word and ink do not match. Under those circumstances, the individuals who are more affected by the Stroop conditions are those with relatively low performance on the operation span test of working memory (carrying out arithmetic problems while remembering words interleaved with those problems). In more recent work, Kane et al. (2007) has shown that low-span individuals have more problems attending in daily life. Participants carried devices that allowed them to respond at unpredictable times during the day, reporting what they were doing, what they wanted to be doing, and so on. It was found that low-span individuals were more likely to report that their minds were wandering away from the tasks on which they were trying to focus attention. This, however, did not occur on all tasks. The span-related difference in attending was only for tasks in which they reported that they wanted to pay attention. When participants reported that they were bored and did not want to pay attention, mind-wandering was just as prevalent for high spans as for low spans. Although this work was done on adults, it has implications for children as well. Gathercole, Lamont, and Alloway (2006) suggest that working memory failures appear to be a large part of learning disabilities. Children who were often accused of not trying to follow directions tested out as children with low working memory ability. They were often either not able to remember instructions or not able to muster the resources to stick to the task goal and pay attention continually, for the duration needed. Children with various kinds of learning and language disability generally test below grade level on working memory procedures, and children with low working memory and executive function don’t do well in school (e.g., Sabol & Pianta, 2012). Of course, central executive processes must do more than just maintain the task goal. The way in which information is converted from one form to another, the vigilance with which the individual searches for meaningful connections between elements and new solutions, and self-knowledge about what areas are strong or weak all probably play important roles in learning. Working Memory and Mnemonic Strategies There also are special strategies that are needed for learning. For example, a sophisticated rehearsal strategy for free recall of a list involves a rehearsal method that is cumulative. If the first word on the list is a cow, the second is a fish, and the third a stone, one ideally should rehearse cumulatively: cow…cow, fish….cow, fish, stone… and so on (Ornstein & Naus, 1978). Cowan, Saults, Winterowd, and Sherk (1991) showed that young children did not carry out cumulative rehearsal the way older children do and could not easily be trained to do so, but that their memory improved when cumulative rehearsal was overtly supported by cumulative presentation of stimuli. For long-term learning, maintenance rehearsal is not nearly as effective a strategy as elaborative rehearsal, in which a coherent story is made on the basis of the items; this takes time but results in richer associations between items, enhancing long-term memory provided that there is time for it to be accomplished (e.g., Craik & Watkins, 1973). In addition to verbal and elaborative rehearsal, Barrouillet and colleagues (2011) have discussed attentional refreshing as a working-memory maintenance process. We do not yet know what refreshing looks like on a moment-to-moment basis or what implications this kind of maintenance strategy has for long-term learning. It is a rich area for future research. The most general mnemonic strategy is probably chunking (Miller, 1956), the formation of new associations or recognition of existing ones in order to reduce the number of independent items to keep track of in working memory. The power of chunking is seen in special cases in which individuals have learned to go w","question":null,"answer":null},{"id":null,"source":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/","content":"ay beyond the normal performance. Ericsson, Chase, and Faloon (1980) studied an individual who learned, over the course of a year, to repeat lists of about 80 digits from memory. He learned to do so starting with a myriad of athletic records that he knew so that, for example, 396 might be recoded as a single unit, 3.96 minutes, a fairly fast time for running the mile. After applying this intensive chunking strategy in practice for a year, a list of 80 digits could be reduced to several sub-lists, each with associated sub-parts. The idea would be that the basic capacity has not changed but each working-memory slot is filled with quite a complex chunk. In support of this explanation, individuals of this sort still remain at base level (about 7 items) for lists of items that were not practiced in this way, e.g., letters. (For a conceptual replication see Ericsson, Delaney, Weaver, & Mahadevan, 2004; Wilding, 2001) Although we cannot all reach such great heights of expert performance, we can do amazing things using expertise. For example, memorization of a song or poem is not like memorization of a random list of digits because there are logical connections between the words and between the lines. A little working memory then can go a long way. The importance of a good working memory comes in when something new is learned, and logical connections are not yet formed so the working memory load is high. When there are not yet sufficient associations between the elements of a body of material, working memory is taxed until the material can be logically organized into a coherent structure. Working memory is thought to correlate most closely with fluid intelligence, the type of intelligence that involves figuring out solutions to new problems (e.g., Wilhelm & Engle, 2005). However, crystallized intelligence, the type of intelligence that involves what you know, also is closely related to fluid intelligence. The path I suggest here is that a good working memory assists in problem-solving (hence fluid intelligence); fluid intelligence and working memory then assist in new learning (hence crystallized intelligence). Working Memory and Education We have sketched the potential relation between working memory and learning. How is that to be translated into lessons for education? There is a large and diverse literature on this topic. As a starting point to illustrate this diversity, I will describe the chapters chosen for the book, Working memory and education (Pickering, 2006). After an introductory chapter on working memory (A. Baddeley), the book includes two chapters on the relation between working memory and reading (one by P. de Jong and another by K. Cain). There is a chapter on the relation between working memory and mathematics education (R. Bull and K.A. Espy), learning disabilities (H.L. Swanson), attention disorders (K. Cornish and colleagues), and deafness (M. Keehner & J. Atkinson). Other chapters cover more general topics, including the role of working memory in the classroom (S. Gathercole and colleagues), the way to assess working memory in children (S. Pickering), and sources of working memory deficit (M. Minear and P. Shah). It is clear that many avenues of research relate working memory to education, and I cannot travel along all of them in this review. To organize a diverse field, what I can do is to distinguish between several different basic approaches have been tried. First, one can try to teach to the level of the learner’s working memory. The points described in the article up to this point should be kept in mind when one is trying to discern and understand what a particular learner can and cannot do. Second, one can try to use training exercises to improve working memory, which, investigators have hoped, would allow a person to be able to learn more and solve problems more successfully. The message I would give here is to be wary, given the rudimentary state of the evidence in a difficult field and the plethora of companies selling working memory training exercises. Third, one might contemplate the role of working memory for the most critical goals of education, in a broad sense. These topics will be examined one at a time. Teaching to the Level of Working Memory The classic adaptation of education to cognitive development and the needs of learning has been to try to adjust the materials to fit the learner. For example, there has been considerable discussion of the need to delay teaching concepts of arithmetic at least until the children understand the basic underlying concept of one-to-one correspondence; that is, the idea that there are different numbers in a series and that each number is assigned to just one object, in order to count the objects (e.g., Gelman, 1982). Halford et al. (2007) provide rough description of what complexity of concepts to expect for each age range, based on working-memory limits (see also Pascual-Leone & Johnson, 2011). There also are individual differences within an age group in ability that affect how the materials are processed. For example, individuals lower in working memory may prefer to take in information using a verbatim, shallow, or surface processing strategy, rather than try to extract the gist (for one relevant investigation, albeit with mixed results, see Kyndt, Cascallar, & Dochy, 2012). The enjoyment of technological presentations may be greater in students with better abilities in the most relevant types of working memory (e.g., Garcia, Nussbaum, & Preiss, 2011). I would note that the educational enterprise requires that the teacher must decide whether it is best to allow the learner to use a favored strategy, which may be influenced by the student’s ability level, or whether it is possible in some cases to instill a more effective strategy even if it does not come naturally to the student. Sweller and colleagues (Sweller, 2011; Sweller, van Merrienboer, & Paas, 1998) have summarized a body of research literature and a theory about the role of cognitive load in learning and education. Their cognitive load theory is “a theory that emphasizes working memory constraints as determinants of instructional design effectiveness” (Sweller et al., 1998). The theory distinguishes between an intrinsic cognitive load that comes from material to be learned and an extraneous cognitive load that should be kept small enough that the cognitive resources of the learner are not overly depleted by it. The theory is importantly placed in an evolutionary framework that I will not describe (though above I mentioned the theory’s incorporation of the distinction between biologically primary and secondary information). This theory has the advantage of being rather nuanced in that many ramifications of cognitive load are considered. With too high a cognitive load, one runs the risk of the student not being able to follow the presentation, whereas with too low a cognitive load, one runs the risk of insufficient engagement. In future, it might be possible to refine the predictions for classroom learning by combining cognitive load theory with theories of cognitive development, which make some specific predictions about how much capacity is present at a particular age in childhood (e.g., Halford et al., 2007). For further discussion of the theory as applied specifically to multimedia, see Schüler, Scheiter, and Genuchten (2011). Issues arise as to how printed items are encoded (visually, verbally, or both) and how much the combination of verbal and visual codes in multimedia should be expected to tax a common, central cognitive resource and therefore interfere with one another, even when they are intended to be synergic. Both in cognitive psychology and in education, these are key issues currently under ongoing investigation. An advantage of multimedia and computerized instruction is the possibility of adjusting the instruction to the student’s level. This might be done partly on the basis of success; if the student succeeds, the materials can be made more challenging whereas, if the student fails, the materials can be made easier. One potential pitfall to watch for is that, while some students will want to press slightly beyond their zone of comfort and will learn well, others will want an easy time, and may choose to learn less than they would be capable of learning. One way to cope with these issues is through computerized instruction, but with a heavy dose of personal monitoring and adjustment to make sure that the task is sufficiently motivating for every student. One factor that makes it difficult to teach to the students effectively is that the working memory demands of language production do not always match the demands of the recipients’ language comprehension. Consequently, when one is speaking or writing for didactic purposes, one must be careful to consider not only one’s own working memory needs, but also those of the listener or reader. There are several obstacles in this regard. Slevc (2011) showed that speakers tend to blurt out what is most readily available in working memory. He used situations that were to be described verbally by the participant, e.g., A pirate gave a book to the monk. If one piece of information had already been presented, it was more likely to be described first. For example, if the monk had been presented already but not the book, the participant was more likely to phrase the description differently, as A pirate gave the monk a book. This assignment of priority to given information is generally appropriate, given that the speaker and listener (or writer and reader) share the same given information. In this case, though, Slevc shows that the tendency to describe given information first was diminished when the speaking participant was under a working memory load. In a didactic situation such as giving a lecture, it thus seems plausible that the memory load inherent in the situation (remembering and planning what one wants to say in the coming segments of a lecture) may cause the lecturer sometimes to use awkward grammatical structure. Moreover, as mentioned above, learning to speak or write well requires that one bear in mind possible difference between what one knows as the speaker (or writer) and what the listener (or reader) knows at key moments. For example, if one says, “Marconi was the inventor of the modern radio,” then, by the time the full topic of the sentence is known, the name is most likely no longer in the listener’s or student’s working memory. If, however, one says, “The modern radio was invented by a man named Marconi,” the context is set up first, making it easier to retain the name. Bearing in mind what the listener or reader knows and does not yet know is likely to be important both for educators in their own speaking and writing, and also in order to teach students how to speak and write effectively. Working Memory Training A much more controversial approach is to use training regimens to improve working memory, thereby improving performance on the educational learning tasks that require working memory (e.g., Klingberg, 2010). It is controversial partly because many people have spent a great deal of money purchasing such training programs before the scientific community has reached an agreement about the efficacy of such programs. Doing working memory training studies is not easy. One needs a control group that is just as motivated by the task as the training group but without the working memory training aspect. The training task must be adaptive (with rewards for performance that continues to improve with training) and a non-adaptive control group does not adequately control arousal and motivation. Some task that is adaptive but involves long-term learning instead of working memory training may be adequate. Several large-scale reviews and studies have suggested that working memory training sometimes improves performance on the working memory task that is trained, but does not generalize to reasoning tasks that must rely on working memory (in adults, Redick et al., 2013, and Shipstead, Redick, & Engle, 2012; in children, Melby-Lervåg & Hulme, 2013). In somewhat of a contrast, other reviews suggest that the training of executive functions (inhibiting irrelevant information, updating working memory, controlling attention, etc.) does extend at least to tasks that use similar processes (Diamond & Lee, 2011) and some basically concur also for working memory (Chein & Morrison, 2010)","question":null,"answer":null},{"id":null,"source":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727/","content":". So there is an ongoing controversy, even among those who have written meta-analyses and reviews of research. One might ask how it is possible to improve working memory without having the effect of improving performance on other tasks that rely on working memory. This can happen because there are potentially two ways in which training can improve task performance. First, working memory training theoretically might increase the function of a basic process, much as a muscle can be strengthened through practice. (Or at least, individuals might learn that through diligent exertion of their attention and effort, they can do better.) That is presumably the route hoped for in training of working memory or executive function. Second, though, it is possible for working memory training to result in the discovery of a strategy for completing the task that is better than the strategy used initially. This can improve performance on the task being trained, but the experience and the strategy learned may well be irrelevant to performance on other educational tasks, even those that rely on working memory. This route might be expected if, as I suspect, participants typically look for a way to solve a problem that is not very attention-demanding, unless the payoff is high. If there is successful working memory training, another issue is whether training is capable of producing super-normal performance or whether it is mostly capable of rectifying deficiencies. By way of analogy, consider physical exercise. If a person is already walking 6 miles a day, there might be little benefit to the heart of adding aerobic exercise. Similarly, if a person is already highly engaged in the environment and using attention control often and effectively during the day, there might be little benefit to the brain of adding working memory exercises. It remains quite conceivable, though, that such exercises are beneficial to certain individuals who are under-utilizing working memory. Nevertheless, as Diamond and Lee (2011) points out, there might be social or emotional reasons why this is the case and such factors would need to be addressed along with, or in some cases instead of, working memory training per se. Working Memory and the Ultimate Goals of Education What is the difference between learning and education? This is a question that has long been asked (for a history of the early period of educational psychology in the United States, for example, see Hall, 2003). Do children learn better when they are fed the information intensively, or allowed to explore the material? Should all children be expected to learn the same material, or should children be separated into different tracks and taught the information that is thought to help them the most in their own most likely future walks of life? A fundamental difference between learning and education, many would agree, is that education should facilitate the acquisition of skills that will promote continued learning after the student leaves school. Of course, after the student leaves school, a major difference is that there is no teacher to decide what is to be learned, or how. Therefore, what seems to be most important, many would agree, is critical thinking skills. There is some sentiment that these skills can be trained (although for an opposing view see Tricot & Sweller, in press). For example, Halpern (1998 p. 449) suggests the following emphases for training critical thinking: “(a) a dispositional component to prepare learners for efforiful cognitive work, (b) instruction in the skills of critical thinking, (c) training in the structural aspects of problems and arguments to promote transcontextual transfer of critical-thinking skills, and (d) a metacognitive component that includes checking for accuracy and monitoring progress toward the goal.” Although I could find few well-controlled, peer-reviewed studies supporting the notion that it is possible to train critical thinking skills, optimistic evidence is beginning to roll in. For example, Shim and Walczak (2012) found that professors asking challenging questions resulted in more improvement in both subjective and objective measures of critical thinking. The objective measure required that students clarify, analyze, evaluate, and extend arguments, and increased 0.55 standardized units for every 1-unit increase in the rating of challenging questions asked. The gain was much stronger in students with high pretest scores in critical thinking. Halpern et al. (2012) have designed a computerized module to train critical thinking skills and obtained very encouraging initial results, with well-controlled training experiments in progress according to the report. One can then ask, to what extent is the training of these higher-level skills dependent on the student’s working memory ability? The association is likely to be substantial, given the high correlation between working memory and reasoning ability even among normal adults (Kyllonen & Christal, 1990; Süβ, Oberauer, Wittmann, Wilhelm, & Schulze, 2002). There is the possibility that training working memory will in some way improve reasoning and vice versa, though most would agree at this point that the case has not yet been completely made (e.g., Jaeggi & Buschkuehl, 2013; Shipstead et al., 2012). A current interest of mine is to understand how fallacies in reasoning might be related to fallacies in working memory performance. There appear to be some similarities between the two. One of the best-known reasoning fallacies is confirmation bias. In a key example (Wason & Shapiro, 1971) participants are given a set of cards laid on the table, each having a letter on one side and a number on the other, and are asked which cards must be turned over to assess a rule (e.g., If a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other side). Participants get that they must turn over the cards that can either confirm or disconfirm the rule (in the example, the cards showing vowels). They often fail to realize that they must also turn over cards that can only disconfirm the rule. In the example, one must turn over cards with odd numbers because the rule is disconfirmed if any of those cards have a vowel on the other side. In contrast, cards that can only confirm the rule are irrelevant. (One should not turn over cards with even numbers because the rule is technically not disconfirmed no matter whether there is a consonant or vowel on the other side.) Chen and Cowan (in press) found performance on a working memory task that closely resembles confirmation bias. In one procedure, a spatial array of letters was presented on each trial, followed by a set of all of the letters at the bottom of the screen and a single location marked; the task was to select the correct letter for the marked location. In another procedure, the spatial array of letters was followed by a single letter from the array at the bottom of the screen and all of the locations marked; the task was to select the correct location for the presented letter. When working memory does not happen to contain the probed item, these procedures allow the use of disconfirming information. In the first task, for example, a participant might reason as follows: The letters were K, R, Q, and L. I know the locations of only R and L and neither of them match the probed location. Therefore, I know that the answer must be K or Q and I will guess randomly between them. That would be comparable to using disconfirming evidence. The pattern of data, however, did not appear to indicate that kind of process. Instead, participants answered correctly if they knew the probed item and otherwise guessed randomly among all of the other choices, without using the process of elimination. A mathematical model that assumed the latter process showed near-perfect convergence in capacity between the procedures described above and the usual change-detection procedure. If we instead assumed a mathematical model of performance in which disconfirming evidence was used through the process of elimination, there was no such convergence between the procedures. So in reasoning and in working memory, processing tends to be inefficient, and it remains to be seen whether it can be meaningfully improved in terms of eliminating confirmation bias. Perhaps people with insufficient working memory or intelligence will always be stuck in such inefficient reasoning and there is nothing we can do. Arguing against that pessimistic view, however, is the recent finding (Stanovich, West, & Toplak, 2013) that the tendency to evaluate evidence more favorably when it agrees with one’s own view occurs across the board and is not correlated with intelligence, and presumably therefore not correlated with working memory either. One might be able to train individuals to make the best use of the working memory they have without worrying about increasing the basic capacity of working memory, either by training critical thinking skills (Halpern, 1989) or by instilling expertise (Eriksson et al., 2004). Conclusion Working memory is the retention of a small amount of information in a readily accessible form, which facilitates planning, comprehension, reasoning, and problem-solving. When we talk of working memory, we often include not only the memory itself, but also the executive control skills that are used to manage information in working memory and the cognitive processing of information. Theoretically, there is still uncertainty about the basic limitations on working memory: are they limitations on concurrent holding capacity, mnemonic processing speed, duration of retention of information before it decays, or just the same sorts of interference properties that apply to long-term memory? While these basic issues are debated and empirical investigations continue, there is much greater agreement about what results are obtained in particular test circumstances; the results of working memory studies seem rather replicable, but small differences in method produce large differences in results, so that one cannot assume that a particular working memory finding is highly generalizable. For learning and education, it is important to take into account the basic principles of cognitive development and cognitive psychology, adjusting the materials to the working memory capabilities of the learner. We are not yet at a point at which every task can be analyzed in advance in order to predict which tasks are doable with a particular working memory capability. It is possible, though, to monitor performance and keep in mind that failure could be due to working memory limitations, adjusting the presentation accordingly. Keeping in mind the limitations of working memory of listeners and readers could easily help to improve one’s lecturing and writing styles. I hope that awareness of working memory leads to a world in which we are all more tolerant of one another’s inability to understand perfectly, are more humble and less arrogant, and are better able to communicate, educate one another, and reach common ground.
