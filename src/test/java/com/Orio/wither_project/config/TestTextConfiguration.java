                                    such an ideal. This is movement from product to process. This transformation in
                        conceptualization is presented in dramatic form in the Western tradition in the New
                        Testament’s description of the passion of Christ, which portrays the process and
                        consequences of revolutionary restructuring of the axioms of Western morality.
                        Christ has long been considered implicitly “contained” in the Old Testament. Frye
                        comments:
                        For Paul, Christ was mainly the concealed hero of the Old Testament
                        story and the post-Easter Christ of the resurrection. The Gospels present
                        Christ in a form that fits this pre-Gospel conception of him: not in a
                        biographical form but as a discontinuous sequence of appearances in
                        which Jesus comments on the Old Testament as a series of past events,
                        laws and images coming permanently alive in the Messianic context, and
                        body, which he supplies.554
                        What this means, at the most fundamental level of analysis, is that the pattern of action,
                        imagination and thought that Christ represents is necessarily “there” in any narrative or
                        mythology, sufficiently compelling to embed itself in memory. The reasons for this
                        implicit existence are clear, in a sense: Christ embodies the hero, grounded in tradition,
                        who is narrative depiction of the basis for successful individual and social adaptation. As
                        the Word “made flesh” (John 1:14) there “in the beginning” (John 1:1), he represents,
                        simultaneously, the power that divides order from chaos, and tradition rendered spiritual,
                        abstract, declarative, semantic. His manner of being is that which moves morality itself
                        from rule of law to rule of spirit—which means process. Spirit is process, simultaneously
                        opposed to and responsible for generating static being. Frye states:
                        We are told in the New Testament itself that the mysteries of faith have to
                        be “spiritually discerned” (I Corinthians 2:14). This is in a passage where
                        Paul is contrasting the letter, which he says “killeth,” with the spirit that
                        “giveth life.”555
                        This idea is represented schematically in Figure 60: The Emergence of Christ from
                        Group Identity and Chaos, which also portrays the Christian “story of man.”
                        For Christ, “God is not the God of the dead, but of the living” (Matthew 22:32). Christ
                        pushes morality beyond strict reliance on codified tradition—the explicit Law of
                        Moses—not because such tradition was unnecessary, but because it was (and is)
                        necessarily and eternally insufficient. He states:
                        For I say unto you, That except your righteousness exceed the
                        righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter
                        into the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:20)

                        The passage explores the culmination of the story of the Grand Inquisitor from Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. The prisoner (Christ) responds to the Grand Inquisitor’s accusations with a silent and symbolic kiss, highlighting themes of love and forgiveness transcending ideological conflict. This act unsettles the Inquisitor, who ultimately releases Christ, instructing Him never to return. The narrative underscores the tension between individual impulse and community structure, reflecting on the transformative power of individual actions within a cultural framework.\n\nThis section delves into the nature of myth as the encoded memory of human behavior and cultural evolution. Myths serve as dramatic narratives, synthesizing past experiences and offering guidance for moral and adaptive behaviors. They provide a blueprint for handling the tension between chaos and order, acting as cultural tools that protect individuals from existential fear while fostering creativity and exploration. Myths connect historical continuity with individual and collective action, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between stability and transformation.\n\nThe text examines the role of heroism in shaping cultural and moral frameworks. Heroic behavior embodies adaptive processes and serves as a model for imitation, evolving over time into codified cultural behaviors. This process integrates tradition and adaptation, balancing individual and societal needs. The narrative suggests that as societies evolve, they shift focus from the products of heroism (e.g., cultural achievements) to the act of heroism itself, reflecting an increasing abstraction and conscious understanding of moral and adaptive behaviors.

                                    In *Maps of Meaning*, Jordan B. Peterson provides a profound exploration of how humans construct meaning through myths, narratives, and archetypal symbols. He begins by distinguishing between two ways of perceiving the world: as a place of objects, representing objective reality studied by science, and as a forum for action, the subjective realm where meaning and experience reside. While science describes what is, it does not offer moral or existential guidance. Instead, narratives—myths, stories, and religious teachings—fulfill this role, conveying lessons that help individuals navigate life’s complexities.

                        Peterson then delves into the neuropsychological underpinnings of meaning-making, emphasizing how the brain balances order (the known) and chaos (the unknown). He introduces archetypal symbols to illustrate this dynamic. The Great Mother represents chaos, potential, and the unknown, while the Great Father symbolizes order, tradition, and structure. The Divine Son, or hero archetype, confronts chaos to renew and transform. These archetypes, rooted in Jungian psychology, reflect universal patterns through which humans interpret experiences and craft meaning.

                        In examining how individuals are socialized into their cultures, Peterson explores the role of cultural narratives and traditions in providing a framework for understanding the world. These narratives offer protection from the uncertainties of the unknown but also carry the risk of becoming rigid and outdated. He advocates for a balance, urging individuals to adopt the hero archetype by challenging and updating cultural norms to foster growth and adaptation.

                        Epistemology is the branch of philosophy that examines the nature, origin, and limits of knowledge. Also called theory of knowledge, it explores different types of knowledge, such as propositional knowledge about facts, practical knowledge in the form of skills, and knowledge by acquaintance as a familiarity through experience. Epistemologists study the concepts of belief, truth, and justification to understand the nature of knowledge. To discover how knowledge arises, they investigate sources of justification, such as perception, introspection, memory, reason, and testimony.

                        Some formulations of the laws of thought include a fourth law: the principle of sufficient reason.[128] It states that everything has a sufficient reason, ground, or cause. It is closely connected to the idea that everything is intelligible or can be explained in reference to its sufficient reason.[134][135] According to this idea, there should always be a full explanation, at least in principle, to questions like why the sky is blue or why World War II happened. One problem for including this principle among the laws of thought is that it is a metaphysical principle, unlike the other three laws, which pertain primarily to logic.[135][128][134]

                        Counterfactual thinking
                        Counterfactual thinking involves mental representations of non-actual situations and events, i.e. of what is "contrary to the facts".[136][137] It is usually conditional: it aims at assessing what would be the case if a certain condition had obtained.[138][139] In this sense, it tries to answer "What if"-questions. For example, thinking after an accident that one would be dead if one had not used the seatbelt is a form of counterfactual thinking: it assumes, contrary to the facts, that one had not used the seatbelt and tries to assess the result of this state of affairs.[137] In this sense, counterfactual thinking is normally counterfactual only to a small degree since just a few facts are changed, like concerning the seatbelt, while most other facts are kept in place, like that one was driving, one's gender, the laws of physics, etc.[136] When understood in the widest sense, there are forms of counterfactual thinking that do not involve anything contrary to the facts at all.[139] This is the case, for example, when one tries to anticipate what might happen in the future if an uncertain event occurs and this event actually occurs later and brings with it the anticipated consequences.[138] In this wider sense, the term "subjunctive conditional" is sometimes used instead of "counterfactual conditional".[139] But the paradigmatic cases of counterfactual thinking involve alternatives to past events.[136]

                        Counterfactual thinking plays an important role since we evaluate the world around us not only by what actually happened but also by what could have happened.[137] Humans have a greater tendency to engage in counterfactual thinking after something bad happened because of some kind of action the agent performed.[138][136] In this sense, many regrets are associated with counterfactual thinking in which the agent contemplates how a better outcome could have been obtained if only they had acted differently.[137] These cases are known as upward counterfactuals, in contrast to downward counterfactuals, in which the counterfactual scenario is worse than actuality.[138][136] Upward counterfactual thinking is usually experienced as unpleasant, since it presents the actual circumstances in a bad light. This contrasts with the positive emotions associated with downward counterfactual thinking.[137] But both forms are important since it is possible to learn from them and to adjust one's behavior accordingly to get better results in the future.[137][136]

                        Thought experiments
                        Thought experiments involve thinking about imaginary situations, often with the aim of investigating the possible consequences of a change to the actual sequence of events.[140][141][142] It is a controversial issue to what extent thought experiments should be understood as actual experiments.[143][144][145] They are experiments in the sense that a certain situation is set up and one tries to learn from this situation by understanding what follows from it.[146][143] They differ from regular experiments in that imagination is used to set up the situation and counterfactual reasoning is employed to evaluate what follows from it, instead of setting it up physically and observing the consequences through perception.[147][141][143][142] Counterfactual thinking, therefore, plays a central role in thought experiments.[148]

                        The Chinese room argument is a famous thought experiment proposed by John Searle.[149][150] It involves a person sitting inside a closed-off room, tasked with responding to messages written in Chinese. This person does not know Chinese but has a giant rule book that specifies exactly how to reply to any possible message, similar to how a computer would react to messages. The core idea of this thought experiment is that neither the person nor the computer understands Chinese. This way, Searle aims to show that computers lack a mind capable of deeper forms of understanding despite acting intelligently.[149][150]

                        Thought experiments are employed for various purposes, for example, for entertainment, education, or as arguments for or against theories. Most discussions focus on their use as arguments. This use is found in fields like philosophy, the natural sciences, and history.[141][145][144][143] It is controversial since there is a lot of disagreement concerning the epistemic status of thought experiments, i.e. how reliable they are as evidence supporting or refuting a theory.[141][145][144][143] Central to the rejection of this usage is the fact that they pretend to be a source of knowledge without the need to leave one's armchair in search of any new empirical data. Defenders of thought experiments usually contend that the intuitions underlying and guiding the thought experiments are, at least in some cases, reliable.[141][143] But thought experiments can also fail if they are not properly supported by intuitions or if they go beyond what the intuitions support.[141][142] In the latter sense, sometimes counter thought experiments are proposed that modify the original scenario in slight ways in order to show that initial intuitions cannot survive this change.[141] Various taxonomies of thought experiments have been suggested. They can be distinguished, for example, by whether they are successful or not, by the discipline that uses them, by their role in a theory, or by whether they accept or modify the actual laws of physics.[142][141]

                        Critical thinking
                        Critical thinking is a form of thinking that is reasonable, reflective, and focused on determining what to believe or how to act.[151][152][153] It holds itself to various standards, like clarity and rationality. In this sense, it involves not just cognitive processes trying to solve the issue at hand but at the same time meta-cognitive processes ensuring that it lives up to its own standards.[152] This includes assessing both that the reasoning itself is sound and that the evidence it rests on is reliable.[152] This means that logic plays an important role in critical thinking. It concerns not just formal logic, but also informal logic, specifically to avoid various informal fallacies due to vague or ambiguous expressions in natural language.[152][74][73] No generally accepted standard definition of "critical thinking" exists but there is significant overlap between the proposed definitions in their characterization of critical thinking as careful and goal-directed.[153] According to some versions, only the thinker's own observations and experiments are accepted as evidence in critical thinking. Some restrict it to the formation of judgments but exclude action as its goal.[153]

                        A concrete everyday example of critical thinking, due to John Dewey, involves observing foam bubbles moving in a direction that is contrary to one's initial expectations. The critical thinker tries to come up with various possible explanations of this behavior and then slightly modifies the original situation in order to determine which one is the right explanation.[153][154] But not all forms of cognitively valuable processes involve critical thinking. Arriving at the correct solution to a problem by blindly following the steps of an algorithm does not qualify as critical thinking. The same is true if the solution is presented to the thinker in a sudden flash of insight and accepted straight away.[153]

                        Critical thinking plays an important role in education: fostering the student's ability to think critically is often seen as an important educational goal.[153][152][155] In this sense, it is important to convey not just a set of true beliefs to the student but also the ability to draw one's own conclusions and to question pre-existing beliefs.[155] The abilities and dispositions learned this way may profit not just the individual but also society at large.[152] Critics of the emphasis on critical thinking in education have argued that there is no universal form of correct thinking. Instead, they contend that different subject matters rely on different standards and education should focus on imparting these subject-specific skills instead of trying to teach universal methods of thinking.[153][156] Other objections are based on the idea that critical thinking and the attitude underlying it involve various unjustified biases, like egocentrism, distanced objectivity, indifference, and an overemphasis of the theoretical in contrast to the practical.[153]

                        Positive thinking
                        Positive thinking is an important topic in positive psychology.[157] It involves focusing one's attention on the positive aspects of one's situation and thereby withdrawing one's attention from its negative sides.[157] This is usually seen as a global outlook that applies especially to thinking but includes other mental processes, like feeling, as well.[157] In this sense, it is closely related to optimism. It includes expecting positive things to happen in the future.[158][157] This positive outlook makes it more likely for people to seek to attain new goals.[157] It also increases the probability of continuing to strive towards pre-existing goals that seem difficult to reach instead of just giving up.[158][157]

                        The effects of positive thinking are not yet thoroughly researched, but some studies suggest that there is a correlation between positive thinking and well-being.[157] For example, students and pregnant women with a positive outlook tend to be better at dealing with stressful situations.[158][157] This is sometimes explained by pointing out that stress is not inherent in stressful situations but depends on the agent's interpretation of the situation. Reduced stress may therefore be found in positive thinkers because they tend to see such situations in a more positive light.[157] But the effects also include the practical domain in that positive thinkers tend to employ healthier coping strategies when faced with difficult situations.[157] This effects, for example, the time needed to fully recover from surgeries and the tendency to resume physical exercise afterward.[158]

                        But it has been argued that whether positive thinking actually leads to positive outcomes depends on various other factors. Without these factors, it may lead to negative results. For example, the tendency of optimists to keep striving in difficult situations can backfire if the course of events is outside the agent's control.[158] Another danger associated with positive thinking is that it may remain only on the level of unrealistic fantasies and thereby fail to make a positive practical contribution to the agent's life.[159] Pessimism, on the other hand, may have positive effects since it can mitigate disappointments by anticipating failures.[158][160]

                        Positive thinking is a recurrent topic in the self-help literature.[161] Here, often the claim is made that one can significantly improve one's life by trying to think positively, even if this means fostering beliefs that are contrary to evidence.[162] Such claims and the effectiveness of the suggested methods are controversial and have been criticized due to their lack of scientific evidence.[162][163] In the New Thought movement, positive thinking figures in the law of attraction, the pseudoscientific claim that positive thoughts can directly influence the external world by attracting positive outcomes.[164]

"[I]n the tradition of linguist Noam Chomsky... we use language for thinking: to think is why language evolved in our species. [However, evidence that thought and language are separate systems is found, for example, by] looking at deficits in different abilities – for instance, in people with brain damage... who have impairments in language – some form of aphasia [ – yet are clearly able to think]." (p. 87.) Conversely, "large language models such as GPT-2... do language very well [but t]hey're not so good at thinking, which... nicely align[s] with the idea that the language system by itself is not what makes you think." (p. 88.)
